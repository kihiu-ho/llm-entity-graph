# Fix for Entity Storage and Search Issues

## Problem
Even after improving entity extraction, Henri Pouret and other entities were not appearing in search results:

```
Query: "Who is Henri Pouret?"
Response: "'Henri Pouret' does not appear to be listed among the publicly available or notable individuals in the current database."

Debug logs show:
- search_people tool called with 'Henri Pouret'
- No results found in knowledge graph
- "There are no direct or indirect relationships between Henri Pouret and IFHA"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that **entities were being extracted but not stored as searchable nodes** in the knowledge graph:

1. **Entity Extraction Working**: The enhanced prompts were successfully extracting Henri Pouret and other entities
2. **Graphiti Episodes Only**: Entities were only stored as metadata in Graphiti episodes, not as structured searchable nodes
3. **Missing Structured Storage**: The `add_person_to_graph` and `add_company_to_graph` functions were not being called
4. **Search Tool Limitation**: The search tools rely on structured entity nodes, not episode metadata

## Solution Applied

### **1. Enhanced Graph Storage Pipeline**

#### **Added Structured Entity Storage**
```python
async def _add_entities_to_graph(self, entities: Dict[str, Any], source_document: str) -> None:
    """Add extracted entities to the knowledge graph as structured nodes."""
    
    # Add people to graph
    people = entities.get('people', [])
    for person_name in people:
        if person_name and isinstance(person_name, str) and person_name.strip():
            logger.info(f"Adding person to graph: {person_name}")
            await add_person_to_graph(
                name=person_name.strip(),
                source_document=source_document
            )
    
    # Add companies to graph
    companies = entities.get('companies', [])
    for company_name in companies:
        if company_name and isinstance(company_name, str) and company_name.strip():
            logger.info(f"Adding company to graph: {company_name}")
            await add_company_to_graph(
                name=company_name.strip(),
                source_document=source_document
            )
```

#### **Added Relationship Storage**
```python
# Add relationships from corporate roles
corporate_roles = entities.get('corporate_roles', {})
for role_category, role_items in corporate_roles.items():
    for role_item in role_items:
        if ' - ' in role_item:
            # Parse "Person Name - Role - Company" format
            parts = role_item.split(' - ')
            person_name = parts[0].strip()
            role = parts[1].strip()
            company = parts[2].strip() if len(parts) > 2 else None
            
            # Add person-role relationship
            await add_relationship_to_graph(
                source_entity=person_name,
                target_entity=role,
                relationship_type="HAS_ROLE",
                description=f"{person_name} has role {role}",
                source_document=source_document
            )
```

### **2. Integrated Entity Storage in Ingestion Pipeline**

#### **Modified Document Processing**
```python
# Collect all entities from all chunks to avoid duplicates
all_entities = {}

# Process chunks and collect entities
for chunk in chunks:
    if hasattr(chunk, 'metadata') and 'entities' in chunk.metadata:
        entities = chunk.metadata['entities']
        # Collect entities for later processing (avoid duplicates)
        self._merge_entities(all_entities, entities)

# Add collected entities to graph as structured nodes
if all_entities:
    logger.info("Adding extracted entities to graph as structured nodes...")
    await self._add_entities_to_graph(all_entities, document_source)
    logger.info("✓ Successfully added entities to graph")
```

### **3. Enhanced Logging and Debugging**

#### **Added Entity Storage Tracking**
```python
logger.info(f"Adding person to graph: {person_name}")
await add_person_to_graph(name=person_name.strip(), source_document=source_document)
logger.debug(f"✓ Added person: {person_name}")

logger.info(f"Adding company to graph: {company_name}")
await add_company_to_graph(name=company_name.strip(), source_document=source_document)
logger.debug(f"✓ Added company: {company_name}")
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Storage Architecture**

#### **Before Fix**
```
Document → Chunks → Entity Extraction → Graphiti Episodes (metadata only)
                                      ↓
                                   Search Tools → No Results ❌
```

#### **After Fix**
```
Document → Chunks → Entity Extraction → Graphiti Episodes (metadata)
                                      ↓
                                   Structured Nodes (searchable)
                                      ↓
                                   Search Tools → Results Found ✅
```

### **Dual Storage Approach**
1. **Graphiti Episodes**: Store full document context with entity metadata
2. **Structured Nodes**: Store individual entities as searchable graph nodes
3. **Relationships**: Store connections between entities with context

### **Entity Deduplication**
- **Collect entities** from all chunks before storage
- **Merge duplicates** using existing `_merge_entities` function
- **Store once per document** to avoid duplicate nodes

## Expected Results

### **Before Fix**
```
Query: "Who is Henri Pouret?"
Response: "Henri Pouret does not appear to be listed among the publicly available or notable individuals in the current database."

Search logs:
- search_people called with 'Henri Pouret'
- No results found
```

### **After Fix**
```
Query: "Who is Henri Pouret?"
Response: "Henri Pouret is the Vice-Chair for Europe at the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA), representing France Galop."

Search logs:
- search_people called with 'Henri Pouret'
- Found: Henri Pouret (Person node)
- Related: France Galop, IFHA, Vice-Chair role
```

### **Relationship Queries**
```
Query: "How is Henri Pouret connected to Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges?"
Response: "Henri Pouret and Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges are both members of the IFHA Executive Council. Henri serves as Vice-Chair for Europe while Winfried serves as Chair."

Query: "What is Henri Pouret's role at IFHA?"
Response: "Henri Pouret serves as Vice-Chair for Europe at the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) and represents France Galop."
```
