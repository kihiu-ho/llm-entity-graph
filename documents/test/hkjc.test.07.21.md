 Chairman’s Statement




permit types, balloting, horse purchase and pedigree confirmation. We have also extended advisory services to Mainland and international members. .

In addition, we have invested significantly in programmes to create racing interest. Our membership team has launched racing engagement experiences and educational programmes to build interest and participation. This year we took strides to create unique lifestyle programmes for members and to foster connections that unite members around shared interests. We ran a Racing Masterclass Series as a fresh approach to racing education with a focus on providing a better understanding of local horse racing. 8.

So at the end of a year of progress both on and off the track, I would like to express my deep gratitude to fellow Stewards for their continued hard work, advice and guidance. In particular, I offer my sincere appreciation to Deputy Chairman Martin Liao, whose support has been invaluable in a challenging year. I am delighted to say we have clear sight of the areas we need to pursue for the Club’s sustainable growth.

I would also like to thank the Board of Management for their unrelenting passion and dedication. The inspirational leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, sets the tone. Our management team has successfully guided the Club through a year of economic challenges while continuing to drive through our business development plans and ensuring the Club maintains its strong support for the community. Last but by no means least, I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to all of our Club’s employees. Without their hard work and commitment, we would not have been able to achieve as much as we have over the past year for the betterment of our society.

Michael T H Lee
