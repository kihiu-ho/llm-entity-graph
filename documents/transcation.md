Directors’ Report
Pursuant to the Master CKHH Telecommunications Supplies Agreement and the Master Purchase Agreement, the relevant members of the Group and of the CKHH Group would enter into separate contracts with respect to the requested CKHH Telecommunications Supplies or Business Related Supplies (as the case may be). The terms of, and the consideration payable under, such contracts would be negotiated on a case-by-case and an arm’s length basis between the parties, and would be on normal commercial terms which, from the Group’s perspective, should be no less favourable to the Group than those which the Group could obtain from independent third party suppliers of comparable CKHH Telecommunications Supplies or Business Related Supplies (as the case may be) in the market. In particular, the Group will seek competitive quotes through tendering or other processes (including conducting a comparison of prices of a sufficient number of independent third party suppliers of comparable CKHH Telecommunications Supplies or Business Related Supplies (as the case may be) in the market) for management review with a view to ensuring that the fees payable by the Group to the CKHH Group in connection with the CKHH Telecommunications Supplies or Business Related Supplies (as the case may be) are fair and reasonable and comparable to those offered by independent third party suppliers having regard to the scope, scale, quality, reliability and service levels of the CKHH Telecommunications Supplies or Business Related Supplies (as the case may be) required and the past performance of the relevant members of the CKHH Group when providing the CKHH Telecommunications Supplies or Business Related Supplies (as the case may be).

The relevant pricing policies of the Group have been followed when determining the price and terms of the relevant transactions contemplated under each of the Master Agreements conducted during 2024.

The Board believes that the entering into of the Master Agreements with CKHH helps ensure that the necessary Supplies will continue to be made available to the Group. It also helps achieve business continuity and efficiency as well as minimise any potential disruption to the daily operation of the Group.

Each of CKHH and the other members of the CKHH Group is a connected person of the Company by virtue of being either a substantial shareholder of the Company at the listed issuer level or an associate of CKHH. Accordingly, the transactions contemplated under the Master Agreements constituted continuing connected transactions (the “Continuing Connected Transactions”) for the Company under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules, in respect of which an announcement dated 13 December 2023 (the “Announcement”) was issued by the Company.

As set out in the Announcement, the annual caps for each of the year ended 31 December 2024 and of the two years ending 31 December 2025 and 2026 in respect of (i) the provision of the Group Telecommunications Supplies to the CKHH Group are HK$60 million, HK$88 million and HK$118 million respectively; (ii) the purchase of the CKHH Telecommunications Supplies by the Group are HK$21 million, HK$25 million and HK$29 million respectively; and (iii) the purchase of the Business Related Supplies by the Group are HK$122 million, HK$142 million and HK$166 million respectively.

All the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, having reviewed the Continuing Connected Transactions entered into by the Group under the Master Agreements during the year ended 31 December 2024 and the findings provided by the internal audit of the Group, confirmed that such transactions were entered into (i) in the ordinary and usual course of business of the Group; (ii) on normal commercial terms or better; and (iii) according to the respective agreements governing them on terms that are fair and reasonable and in the interests of the shareholders of the Company as a whole.
