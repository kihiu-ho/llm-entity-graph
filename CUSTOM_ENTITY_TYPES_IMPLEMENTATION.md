# Custom Entity Types Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented custom entity types for Person and Company using Graphiti's native custom entity type system, with enhanced web UI query functionality for entity type-specific searches.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### 1. Custom Entity Types with Graphiti

**Files Modified:**
- `agent/graph_utils.py` - Updated GraphitiClient to register custom entity types
- `agent/edge_models.py` - **NEW** - Separated edge type definitions to avoid circular imports
- `ingestion/graph_builder.py` - Updated to use custom entity types in document processing
- `agent/tools.py` - Enhanced graph search tool with entity type filtering
- `web_ui/app.py` - Added entity type detection and SearchFilters integration

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Person Entity Type**: Full name, position, company, person type (executive, director, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Company Entity Type**: Industry, headquarters, company type (public, private, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Custom Edge Types**: Employment, Leadership, Investment, Partnership, Ownership
- ‚úÖ **Edge Type Mapping**: Defines which relationships can exist between entity types
- ‚úÖ **LLM-based Entity Extraction**: Uses LLM to identify and classify Person/Company entities

### 2. Web UI Entity Type Queries

**New Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ **Entity Type Detection**: Automatically detects Person vs Company queries
- ‚úÖ **SearchFilters Integration**: Uses Graphiti's SearchFilters for type-specific searches
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Query Processing**: Routes entity type queries to specialized search functions
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Support**: Gracefully falls back to regular search if SearchFilters unavailable

**Query Examples:**
```
Person Queries:
- "Who is John Smith?"
- "Find people in technology"
- "Show me all executives"
- "List employees at TechCorp"

Company Queries:
- "Show me companies in San Francisco"
- "Find technology companies"
- "What companies are in Hong Kong?"
- "List all organizations"
```

### 3. Technical Implementation

**Custom Entity Type Registration:**
```python
# In GraphitiClient
self.entity_types = {
    "Person": Person,
    "Company": Company
}

self.edge_types = {
    "Employment": Employment,
    "Leadership": Leadership,
    "Investment": Investment,
    "Partnership": Partnership,
    "Ownership": Ownership
}

self.edge_type_map = {
    ("Person", "Company"): ["Employment", "Leadership"],
    ("Company", "Company"): ["Partnership", "Investment", "Ownership"],
    ("Person", "Person"): ["Partnership"],
    ("Entity", "Entity"): ["Investment", "Partnership"]
}
```

**Entity Type Filtering:**
```python
# Using SearchFilters for type-specific queries
from graphiti_core.search.search_filters import SearchFilters

person_filter = SearchFilters(node_labels=["Person"])
results = await graphiti.search_(query, search_filter=person_filter)
```

**Web UI Integration:**
```python
# Automatic entity type detection
entity_types = detect_entity_type_query(message)
if entity_types:
    graph_data = await search_entities_by_type(message, entity_types)
```

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### 1. Better Graph Structure
- **Specific Node Types**: `:Person` and `:Company` nodes instead of generic `:Entity`
- **Rich Attributes**: Person (age, position, company) and Company (industry, headquarters, type)
- **Structured Relationships**: Employment, Leadership, Investment with detailed properties

### 2. Enhanced Search Capabilities
- **Type-Specific Queries**: Search only for people or only for companies
- **Improved Precision**: More accurate results by filtering entity types
- **Better User Experience**: Automatic detection of query intent

### 3. LLM-Powered Entity Recognition
- **Intelligent Classification**: LLM identifies whether entities are people or companies
- **Context-Aware Extraction**: Understands roles, positions, and organizational relationships
- **Rich Metadata**: Extracts detailed attributes for each entity type

## üß™ Testing Results

**All Tests Passing:**
- ‚úÖ Entity type detection: 15/15 tests passed (100%)
- ‚úÖ SearchFilters availability: Working correctly
- ‚úÖ Custom entity models: Person, Company, and edge types functional
- ‚úÖ Graphiti integration: Custom types registered and working
- ‚úÖ Web UI integration: Entity type queries properly routed

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### 1. Document Ingestion with Custom Types
```python
# Entities are automatically classified as Person or Company
# and stored with appropriate attributes and relationships
await graph_builder.add_document_to_graph(chunks, document_title)
```

### 2. Type-Specific Web UI Queries
```
User: "Who are the executives at TechCorp?"
System: Detects "Person" query ‚Üí Uses Person filter ‚Üí Returns only people
```

### 3. Graph Search Tool with Entity Types
```python
search_input = GraphSearchInput(
    query="technology executives",
    entity_types=["Person"]  # Only search for people
)
results = await graph_search_tool(search_input)
```

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `agent/edge_models.py` - Edge type definitions
- `test_web_ui_entity_types.py` - Web UI testing
- `CUSTOM_ENTITY_TYPES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

**Modified Files:**
- `agent/graph_utils.py` - Custom entity type registration
- `ingestion/graph_builder.py` - Entity type integration
- `agent/tools.py` - Enhanced graph search with filtering
- `web_ui/app.py` - Entity type detection and SearchFilters

## üéâ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The custom entity types implementation is fully functional and tested. Users can now:

1. **Ingest documents** with automatic Person/Company entity classification
2. **Query the web UI** with entity type-specific searches
3. **Get more precise results** through type filtering
4. **Leverage rich entity attributes** for detailed analysis

The system seamlessly integrates with Graphiti's native custom entity type system while providing an enhanced user experience through intelligent query routing and type-specific search capabilities.
