 Achievements of the Club

This has been a year of considerable achievement for the Club both on and off the track. On the track Hong Kong horses triumphed in Australia, Dubai and Japan and won six out of seven Group 1 races in our two home international racing carnivals. Off the track we launched the Institute of Philanthropy (IoP) and we contributed a record HK$40.1 billion to the community, comprising HK$29.9 billion in betting duty, profits tax and Lotteries Fund contributions and a record HK$10.2 billion in approved charity donations. The latter comprised HK$6.7 billion in regular donations and HK$3.5 billion to the IoP.

2023/24 4012991026735


---

This was despite the Club’s wagering turnover for the financial year being essentially flat and down 0.7 for the racing season due to the challenging economic situation. While we had record football betting turnover, with a 2.2 increase, we faced a 7.9 decline in local racing wagering turnover, which was only partially compensated for by commingling turnover. In combination with HK$2.4 billion in Special Football Betting Duty, the result was a significant reduction in wagering income, which led to a lower operating surplus and reduced donations from the Club to The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. Nonetheless, responding to social needs during this period of hardship, we increased our regular donations significantly above the HK$4.5 billion we had previously committed to. Though this required us to draw on the Club’s and the Trust’s reserves, we saw it as essential to fulfil our purpose of acting for the betterment of our society.

One of the Club’s greatest achievements is the globalisation of racing by exporting our world-class racing overseas. Today Hong Kong races are broadcast to 26 countries and jurisdictions, with overseas bets commingled with the Club’s pools now accounting for 23.7 of local racing turnover. This has enabled us to expand Hong Kong racing’s global footprint, underlining the city’s resilience under One Country, Two Systems. Furthermore, through the expanded World Pool, we offer the best races from around the world and showcase Hong Kong as a global hub for international wagering. Total World Pool turnover this season was up 57.1 to HK$2.1 billion.

Now that overseas sources make up such a large and growing proportion of our revenue, we have been motivated to expand the Club’s contributions beyond Hong Kong. One of our major commitments this year was the launch of the Institute of Philanthropy. Just as our city has become home to world-class racing, so we aspire to become a centre for world-class philanthropy and thought leadership. It is a chance to reinforce Hong Kong’s role as an international hub. At the same time we remain fully committed to supporting charity and community causes in Hong Kong. We are more determined than ever to act continuously for the betterment of our society.

 Hong Kong Racing



Horse racing plays an invaluable role in bringing our community together, as our flagship racedays this season showed. It was truly an extraordinary year of racing achievements. One of the most electrifying meetings was the LONGINES Hong Kong International Races at Sha Tin in December, where a large and passionate crowd witnessed the local horses competing in four Group 1 races.


---

 Chairman’s Statement




roared on our horses to win three of the four Group 1 races. It was

extremely heartening to witness after the pandemic. It also re- established this meeting as one of the premier global racing events of

the year. Perhaps the crowning moment was Golden Sixty’s win in the

Hong Kong Mile on his long-awaited return to action. Deservedly he once again picked up the Champion Miler title at our end-of-season

Champion Awards.

In April, our horses won all three Group 1 races on FWD Champions 4

Day. The two racedays combined attracted 32 overseas runners

from five countries – underlining the world-class status of Hong Kong 32

racing. Impressively, Hong Kong horses also excelled overseas. I was

honoured to witness Romantic Warrior capture the Group 1 Yasuda

Kinen in Tokyo – only the third time one of our horses has prevailed

in this race. He had already won the Group 1 W.S. Cox Plate in

Melbourne, becoming the first Hong Kong horse to do so. It was truly

a remarkable year for this Hong Kong International Sale graduate

– the first Hong Kong horse to win five international Group 1 races

in a single season. He thoroughly deserved to be crowned Horse

of the Year and Most Popular Horse at our Champion Awards. In

addition, California Spangle clocked the fastest time ever run down

the Meydan straight to win the Al Quoz Sprint in Dubai – helping him

earn our Champion Sprinter award. These landmark overseas victories

enhance the profile of Hong Kong racing and showcase our Club’s

investment in world-class racing. We are very proud that four of our

horses ranked in the world’s top 15 for the first time in 2023 – an

incredible achievement given that we have less than 1 of the world’s

racehorses. But while we have some truly outstanding horses at the

top of our sport, we need to generate more strength and depth. With that in 2023

mind, we are working to improve the quantity and quality of our

horses and the size of our ownership base. In support of owners,

we have begun a five-year renovation of our stables at Sha Tin and

we have expanded stabling at Conghua Racecourse. We have also

raised prize money by almost 100 over the last decade to a record

HK$1.73 billion on offer this year. From next season, our 12 Group 1

races alone will offer HK$265 million in total winnings. Moreover, in

recognition of challenging economic conditions, the Club is investing

HK$140 million to reduce livery charges and the cost of exporting

retired horses.

Charities and Community
 Charities and Community

What sets Hong Kong racing apart is the enduring contribution it makes to charities and the community. This is made possible by the Club’s unique integrated business model, through which it provides racing and sports entertainment and channels resultant wagering demand into tax contributions, charity donations and employment opportunities. In 2023/24, the Club donated 93 of its operating surplus after tax to the Trust, which approved HK$10.2 billion in donations to support 173 charity and community projects. Ultimately, we are motivated to find, fund and trial solutions to the challenges society is facing, enjoying an agility and flexibility that allows us to be more creative and efficient in meeting those needs. We achieve this not least through our own Trust-initiated Projects (TIPs).

This year, the Trust launched six new TIPs in collaboration with community partners to address urgent needs in priority areas. Crucially, these are multi-year projects, underlining the importance we place on long-term impact. You can read about them in detail later in this report, but I highlight a few here to offer insights into our thinking.


---

Chairman’s Statement



Positive Ageing and Elderly Care is one of the Trust’s six strategic areas of focus. Given Hong Kong’s pressing ageing demographics, the role of caregivers is crucial in enabling older adults to continue living and thriving at home. As such, under the Jockey Club Carer Space Project, we are working with five non-governmental organisations to develop district-based centres which will connect and support caregivers and provide timely and innovative services. Our goal is to foster a more carer-friendly community.

At the other end of the age spectrum, Youth Development and Poverty Alleviation is another strategic focus. We are committed to helping families break free from the cycle of poverty and to creating opportunities for young people from diverse backgrounds to realise their full potential. At our Community Day race meeting this April, we launched JC PROJECT LIFT to give hope to families living in transitional housing by equipping them with the necessary life skills to transform their trajectories. We are working with community partners across sectors to enhance their competencies, employment prospects and financial literacy. We aim to cover 25 transitional housing projects across the city, covering 70 of total transitional housing residents over the next five years.

Beyond these projects, we are mindful that economic pressures, allied to the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to unprecedented emotional and mental distress for people of all ages and from all walks of life, as work based on our earlier TIP, the Jockey Club FAMILY cohort, has shown. As such, the Trust has approved a donation to fund eight intervention programmes to support the mental health of those at highest risk, in collaboration with the HKSAR Government, non-governmental organisations, social service units, schools and universities. These programmes will provide emotional support at the health, social welfare and education interfaces and intersections and are expected to benefit more than 154,000 people.

As mentioned, our ambition is to generate long-term impact in areas where we have identified the most acute need and where philanthropic catalytic capital can bring about needle-moving change. So I want to showcase some of our pioneering programmes that the HKSAR Government has subsequently adopted and regularised as policy.

Under Talent and Sector Development, in 2016 we launched CoolThink@JC, which takes a computational thinking approach to promote logical reasoning and problem-solving. It aimed to inspire creative use of technology from a young age to prepare students for a computing-rich society. This approach has since been integrated across all publicly funded primary schools in Hong Kong, with its teaching materials shared with schools from the Mainland to the US and New Zealand.

In 2015, we launched the CLAP@JC programme to smooth young people’s transition from school to work. Linking the education, business and community sectors, it sets out a career guidance framework to help young people take ownership of their life choices and navigate into their chosen profession. The Hong Kong Benchmark (HKBM) has successfully uplifted the industry standard and is today used at close to a third of secondary schools and youth service centres. The Education Bureau has adopted the HKBM framework and its online platform in order to expand the coverage to all secondary schools, while more than 3,000 employers are currently using the new CV360® developed by CLAP@JC for effective talent-matching. Internationally, the CV360® is now listed on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) “Observatory on Digital technologies in Career guidance for Youth” as an open source of best practice.

Healthy Community is another priority area. In 2015, we launched JC A-Connect – the first comprehensive project to support autistic children in mainstream schools in collaboration with community partners. The Education Bureau has integrated elements of this inclusive programme for the neuro-diverse into mainstream education from the 2021/22 academic year and has since initiated a linked learning platform for parents and teachers.

At the same time, the Club is committed to creating a culturally vibrant Hong Kong. This year marked the sixth anniversary of Tai Kwun – the three declared monuments of the former Central Police Station compound conserved and revitalised by the Club into a cultural heritage and arts centre. Winner of the Award for Excellence at the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation, Tai Kwun has welcomed over 18 million visitors since opening in 2018. In the past year alone it received a record 4.6 million visitors, mostly below the age of 40, who have enjoyed a colourful mix of exhibitions, festivals and performances. As such it has become a go-to tourist attraction, helping Hong Kong relaunch itself as a tourist destination and mega events hub.

No less important has been the Club’s support for the Hong Kong Palace Museum, constructed with the aid of a HK$3.5 billion donation from the Trust, which is also supporting talent development initiatives, exhibitions and educational programmes at the museum. In this way the Club is contributing to the vision of Hong Kong as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, as outlined in the National 14th Five-Year Plan.

The great majority of the charity projects I have mentioned above are run in collaboration with community partners. In addition, the Trust supports community facilities established by the Club, namely Tai Kwun, The Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course and

Chairman’s Statement


three public riding schools. To provide a long-term funding base for their operations and development, the Trust this year earmarked HK$4.9 billion. In this way we aim to ensure a sustainable future for these popular and much-used public facilities in line with the Club’s betterment purpose.

 Institute of Philanthropy



We were delighted to host our third Philanthropy for Better Cities Forum last September, after a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing together 1,600 delegates from around the world to discuss key issues facing societies worldwide. After several years of disruption due to the global pandemic, it was great to see Hong Kong back where it belongs on the world stage. I am proud to report that this has become one of the key events on the global philanthropic calendar.

91,600

At the forum, in the presence of the HKSAR Chief Executive, I announced the establishment of the Institute of Philanthropy (IoP), supported by an approved combined donation of HK$5.0 billion from the Club and the Trust. Subsequently, a further HK$1.8 billion was provided to the IoP, enabling landmark donations supporting two iconic projects in the Mainland, as detailed below. This historic investment in the IoP signals the Club’s determination to further its thought leadership in philanthropic giving, by providing a sharing platform for leading and emerging funders nationally and throughout Asia, from the Middle East to the Far East.

Collectively, our mission is to become a leading independent “think-fund-do” tank, rooted in the East and for the world. We aim to define the Asian way of giving and to spur good intentions into actions to better societies everywhere.

（）

The IoP’s initial foci are global health and the effects of climate change on health. Such global issues require global solutions and to maximise synergetic impacts the IoP has been busy forging strategic partnerships with key international organisations and fellow foundations.



To address the impact of climate change on health, the IoP has joined hands with the Rockefeller Foundation and it is supporting the World Health Organization’s efforts to safeguard the health of migrant and displaced populations affected by climate change. This is the Club’s first collaboration with one of the oldest philanthropic foundations in the world and the first-ever contribution to a specialised agency of the United Nations.

 Recognising that COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic

The IoP is also partnering with the Trust to provide HK$3.0 billion in support of preparedness and prevention initiatives announced in the HKSAR Chief Executive’s 2023 Policy Address. The Trust is supporting the establishment of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Global Health Institute – the first institution dedicated to bringing the latest vaccine technology to the city through collaboration with the International Vaccine Institute and the universities of Cambridge and Hong Kong. It is also supporting the Health Bureau to strengthen local infectious disease prevention and preparedness and to enhance co-operation in the Greater Bay Area.

Meanwhile, at the national level, the IoP has signed two co-operation agreements with the National Health Commission to help develop health talent in the Mainland. These highlight the IoP’s support for the Healthy China 2030 Blueprint and the 14th Five-year Plan on Health Talent Development.

Building on the Club’s strong track record of heritage conservation, the IoP has also signed a memorandum of co-operation with the Palace Museum in Beijing. Under a five-year collaboration the two parties will join hands to promote Chinese culture and values in Hong Kong, the Mainland and worldwide. This includes establishing the Palace Museum Hong Kong Cultural Exchange Hub through conservation of the historic Chengqiangong.

We are very much looking forward to welcoming the international community back to Hong Kong for our fourth Philanthropy for Better Cities Forum this September. It will be a valuable opportunity to demonstrate the Trust’s commitment to tackling critical social issues. It also provides a platform for us to showcase the expertise we have developed across decades of working with policymakers, businesses, non-governmental organisations, academics, scientists and philanthropic organisations. At the forum we will also be sharing two specially commissioned reports on social impact measurement and a special supplement on social impact from the influential Stanford Social Innovation Review.

 Nurturing Hong Kong’s Equestrian Talent

The Club is a strong supporter of equestrian sport in Hong Kong. In particular we seek to nurture the potential of elite equestrians through the HKJC Equestrian Team and the Hong Kong Equestrian Performance Plan, which provides high-level coaching and professional support. With the benefit of Club support, Hong Kong, China riders have gone on to great success, including winning Hong Kong’s first ever Asian Games equestrian gold medal.

 Chairman’s Statement



Games gold medal in equestrian sport at the 18th Asian Games. I was therefore thrilled to see Club-supported riders create history once again by winning two medals at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. They claimed a bronze in team dressage – Hong Kong, China’s first medal in the discipline at the Asian Games – and a silver in individual dressage. Overall, we sent nine athletes to Hangzhou, comprising the largest equestrian squad Hong Kong, China has ever sent to the Asian Games.

To celebrate the team’s performance and to honour our medallists, we hosted a raceday at Sha Tin. In all, more than 80 medallists across 18 disciplines at the Games attended, as well as HKSAR Government officials and representatives of national sports associations. We presented cheques to the medallists courtesy of the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which was initiated last year through the Hong Kong Sports Institute.

In November, the Hong Kong, China equestrian team also won a gold medal in group B of the jumping team competition at the First Student (Youth) Games of the People’s Republic of China in Guangxi. It marked the team’s first medal at the Games – setting another milestone for equestrian sports in Hong Kong. All of the riders are members of the Club’s Equestrian Youth Squad (Mainland).

In addition, the Club has long been a strong supporter of para-equestrian sport through its public riding schools and the HKJC Equestrian Team. I wish the very best of luck to our Hong Kong, China representative in individual para dressage at this year’s 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. Qualifying is an incredible achievement and a testament to hard work and dedication. I sincerely hope this will promote greater awareness of para equestrian sport.

To promote equestrian sport, the Club has established three public riding schools, which have always had a long waiting list. To further promote grass-roots development, the Club has invested HK$375 million to redevelop the public riding school at Pok Fu Lam. In close collaboration with the HKSAR Government, the Club is actively pursuing opportunities to develop a fourth public riding school in the next few years.

 Mainland Equine Development



The Mainland is key to the Club’s vision for the future. We are strongly committed to supporting the development of its equine industry and equine sports. Most recently we demonstrated this through our support for the equestrian competition of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, where we provided technical support in six functional areas, namely biosecurity, horse transportation, stable management,

 Veterinary and Farriery Services

Stakeholder engagement. All of this contributed to the success of the Games, for which we were honoured with the title “Outstanding Contributor to the Hangzhou Asian Games”.

We especially believe that the Greater Bay Area can become a hub for a world-class equine industry, in doing so contributing to economic and social development. Central to our plans is Conghua Racecourse, whose world-class training facilities are already having a huge impact on Hong Kong racing by producing a growing number of winners. It is also bringing many benefits to Conghua district, providing much-needed employment and contributing to rural revitalisation.

We can’t wait to host racing at Conghua in 2026. It will be a historic landmark – a platform to showcase our Club’s capabilities and the many benefits that racing can bring to the Mainland. Our preparations are well on track, including construction of an eye-catching grandstand with a roof featuring a large installation of solar panels. We also acquired land in Conghua this year to build an equine transfer station that will facilitate the import and export of horses into the Mainland. It will enable horses bred or raced in the Mainland to obtain an internationally recognised health standard so they can take part in races and equestrian events in Hong Kong and worldwide.

Later this year we will open the HKJC Shenzhen Centre, providing a meeting space for members and thought leaders and serving as an important brand platform to share information on equine sports and the Club’s charity mission.

Over the longer term, we aspire to be part of an equine industry value chain similar to that in other jurisdictions, encompassing everything from breeding to racing. It will take time to develop, but the potential economic and employment benefits are significant.

 Members



Members are the beating heart of our Club, which is why we continue to elevate the quality of the products, services and experiences we offer. Racing remains our core and we constantly strive to improve the Club’s offering for horse owners and potential owners. Last year we opened a new multi-level car park at Sha Tin Racecourse and we have also renovated owners’ boxes at Happy Valley. This year we also commenced the renovation of the Members’ Main Entrance at Sha Tin. We are working to enhance the ownership experience, offering seminars, webinars and other live events on subjects such as horse import permits, horse drawing lots, purchasing horses and pedigree certificates.

 Chairman’s Statement




permit types, balloting, horse purchase and pedigree confirmation. We have also extended advisory services to Mainland and international members. .

In addition, we have invested significantly in programmes to create racing interest. Our membership team has launched racing engagement experiences and educational programmes to build interest and participation. This year we took strides to create unique lifestyle programmes for members and to foster connections that unite members around shared interests. We ran a Racing Masterclass Series as a fresh approach to racing education with a focus on providing a better understanding of local horse racing. 8.

So at the end of a year of progress both on and off the track, I would like to express my deep gratitude to fellow Stewards for their continued hard work, advice and guidance. In particular, I offer my sincere appreciation to Deputy Chairman Martin Liao, whose support has been invaluable in a challenging year. I am delighted to say we have clear sight of the areas we need to pursue for the Club’s sustainable growth.

I would also like to thank the Board of Management for their unrelenting passion and dedication. The inspirational leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, sets the tone. Our management team has successfully guided the Club through a year of economic challenges while continuing to drive through our business development plans and ensuring the Club maintains its strong support for the community. Last but by no means least, I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to all of our Club’s employees. Without their hard work and commitment, we would not have been able to achieve as much as we have over the past year for the betterment of our society.

 Chief Executive Officer’s Statement




The 2023/24 season was a vintage one for Hong Kong racing. Romantic Warrior became the first Hong Kong horse to win the W.S. Cox Plate in Australia, while in Japan he followed in the footsteps of Fairy King Prawn and Bullish Luck to take the Yasuda Kinen. Together with victories in the LONGINES Hong Kong Cup, the Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup and the FWD QEII Cup he wrote a new chapter in Hong Kong racing history. In Dubai, California Spangle’s win in the Al Quoz Sprint established him as one of Hong Kong’s racing stars, while our international carnivals, the LONGINES Hong Kong International Races and FWD Champions Day, saw Hong Kong horses win six out of seven Group 1 races against top global talent. Meanwhile, Vincent Ho became the first home-grown jockey to win the LONGINES International Jockeys’ Championship. To cap it all, all 12 of Hong Kong’s international Group 1 races featured in the LONGINES World’s Top 100 Group 1 Races for the very first time.

2023/24122023

On the business side, however, we faced significant external challenges. These included the difficult macro-economic environment, especially the slowdown in the Mainland economy, the increasing threat of illegal gambling, which is growing much faster than the legal market, and the reopening and aggressive marketing of Macau casinos.

Above all, there is the fundamental change in consumer behaviour after the pandemic. Increasing levels of outbound travel, as customers seek new experiences and value-for-money offerings in destinations like Shenzhen, has impacted social entertainment like race-going as well as wagering on racing. The proliferation of digital entertainment, which began during the pandemic, has also persisted.

Our racing business was impacted most of all, resulting in a decline this season of 9.3 in local racing turnover, with our high-value racing customer segment experiencing an even bigger decline. Also having a major impact was a significant decrease in the horse population. Here a high retirement rate and the difficulties experienced by owners in replenishing their horse stock during the pandemic led to a sub-optimal horse population. The resulting small field sizes negatively impacted turnover.

9.3

 Our strategy of globalising Hong Kong racing via commingling and expanding our customer base globally

was able to partly mitigate the decline in local turnover. With more than 70 commingling partners in 26 countries and jurisdictions, including Malaysia for the first time, turnover increased by 13.7 to HK$28.8 billion. In total, 23.7 of local racing turnover now comes from overseas commingling, underlining that Hong Kong now offers a premier global racing wagering product.

Based on this success, and our liquidity and technology, we introduced the World Pool six years ago, which offers global wagering on the very best international races. This season saw an additional 83 races offered and World Pool turnover up 57.1 to HK$2.1 billion. Total simulcasting and World Pool turnover was up 8.7 to HK$12.8 billion.

However, this was not sufficient to offset the decline in racing wagering, where overall turnover this season declined by 4.5 to HK$134.7 billion. Income from racing was down 4.2 to HK$6.1 billion, that is HK$270 million below the 2022/23 season. Income from Hong Kong customers was down 7.8 or HK$397 million.

Football turnover, on the other hand, was up 2.2 to a record HK$160.3 billion for the financial year. Here new innovative wagering products such as Early Settlement and Same Game All Up were well-received by customers, as was the introduction of 24-hour operations, which is vital to combat illegal operators who span multiple time-zones. An increase in the number of matches and in-play offerings, which were launched in time for major international tournaments, including Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024, were also important factors. However, due to the full-year effect of Special Football Betting Duty, under which the Club is paying an additional HK$2.4 billion in duty per year for five years starting from April 2023, the Club’s income from football was down 16.6 to HK$8.1 billion.

More encouraging was the performance of the Mark Six, where refinements to the jackpot reserve model enabled the Club to offer more and higher jackpots. In consequence, Mark Six turnover for the financial year was up 13.3 to HK$8.5 billion. Income to the Club was up by the same percentage to HK$0.5 billion.

 Chief Executive Officer’s Statement



As a result, the Club’s total wagering turnover for the racing season was down 0.7 to HK$303.6 billion, with total wagering income to the Club for the season down 11.0 to HK$14.8 billion, largely due to the full-year effect of Special Football Betting Duty.

0.73,03611.0148

This negative impact was reflected in the Club’s EBITDA, which declined from HK$8.3 billion to HK$5.5 billion this season, with our operating surplus after tax declining to HK$2.6 billion. As a result, the Club’s donation to The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust was lower than last year, down from HK$4.6 billion to HK$2.45 billion, though this still comprised 93 of our operating surplus after tax.

（EBITDA）83552646245,00093

Nonetheless, the Club was determined to maintain its strong support for the community. Here the Trust did not just maintain its current commitment of HK$4.5 billion in approved donations but exceeded it, approving HK$6.7 billion in regular donations plus a HK$3.5 billion special donation to the Institute of Philanthropy. At HK$10.2 billion, approved Trust donations set a new record for the Club.

456735102

Overall, and despite all the challenges of the past year, the Club’s total contribution to the community was a record HK$40.1 billion for the financial year, comprising not only record approved charity donations but a record HK$29.9 billion in betting duty, profits tax and Lotteries Fund contributions.

401299

Meanwhile, our Investment Office, which manages the Club’s financial assets, has again delivered outstanding results despite the challenging macro environment and relatively high interest rates throughout the year. It generated HK$3.4 billion for the Club and HK$4.4 billion for the Trust. Our overall reserves did, however, suffer a decline, especially Trust reserves.

3444

Taking account of Trust allocations awaiting payment and the substantial donations disbursed, including to the Institute of Philanthropy, Trust reserves fell by HK$1.5 billion to HK$39.5 billion.

Corporate Strategy Review


In light of these challenges, the Club’s management initiated an all-encompassing strategy review. The Corporate Strategy Framework, including a holistic strategy for Mainland development, was presented to the Board of Stewards, with a focus on six strategic priorities.

Going forward we will focus on growing our world-class racing by improving the quality and quantity of horses and increasing the ownership base. We will enhance customer centricity to better understand our customers holistically and to grow our customer and ownership base.

We will expand the Club’s World Pool offerings and commingling to make Hong Kong the hub for parimutuel horse racing wagering. We will also enhance our current wagering products, especially in racing and football, to combat the growing illegal market and to channel wagering demand for community benefit. Here we will work closely with the HKSAR Government and law enforcement agencies, sharing information about the growth of illegal sports betting, including on other sports, to help determine whether this demand needs to be legally channelled for the protection and benefit of the community.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement


We will further invest in our IT capabilities to enable growth for the future as well as to mitigate significantly increased IT risks, including cyber security risks. We will continue to demonstrate the substantial benefits of the Club’s unique integrated business model in contributing to social betterment. In the Mainland, where regular racing will commence at Conghua Racecourse in 2026, we will continue to provide substantial support for equine industry development in the Greater Bay Area and beyond.

 Growing our World-Class Racing



To sustain our world-class racing, we must address the challenges facing our horse population, where we face issues of both quantity and quality. The fact is that in the four years since 2019/20, our horse population has declined by over 9, from 1,320 to 1,196. Moreover, while we have achieved excellent results at the top level, with 14 horses in the 2023 LONGINES World’s Best Racehorse Rankings, we currently have the lowest number of Class 2 horses in 20 years. All of this had a direct impact on field sizes this season, with consequent impacts on turnover.

Encouragingly, thanks to increased prize money and the Private Purchase (PP) and Private Purchase Griffin (PPG) bonus schemes, horse imports have increased. But given the economic realities at present, we also need to address the cost of ownership. From next season, the Club will therefore invest HK$140 million to cut basic monthly livery charges by 20 and to provide additional support for owners exporting racehorses after retirement. Given the pressures on our owners, we see this as an absolute necessity to sustain the horse population we need to maintain our racing business.

Looking forward we must also ensure that horse ownership remains a rewarding and accessible experience. This means continuing to offer competitive prize money and ensuring that permit and ballot policies support those who want to participate at the highest level.

We must also strengthen our ownership pipeline, not only by cultivating the ownership interest of the Club’s membership base but by broadening the sources of ownership. Here The Racing Club, established some 16 years ago, has proven extremely successful in grooming racing and ownership interest. Under our Racing Club 2.0 strategy we aim to build on this success, increasing the membership intake and expanding current facilities. In addition, we will seek to...

to recruit potential owners in the Mainland as well as renowned international owners overseas. All of these efforts will be underpinned by enriched owner education and engagement driven by a dedicated cross-divisional task force from Racing and Membership.

Equally, the Club is committed to providing a world-class training environment for owners’ horses. Here Conghua Racecourse, now in its sixth season of operation, has more than proved its value. This season alone, 186 horses benefiting from its facilities scored a total of 243 victories, up 41 on last season. With new stables added this year, Conghua’s total capacity has increased to more than 1,000 horses. Meanwhile, in April, we commenced a much-needed HK$2.4 billion refurbishment of Sha Tin stables.

Alongside this investment in facilities, the Club is committed to attracting and developing top training and riding talent, both from overseas and locally. As the thrilling contest between Francis Lui and Pierre Ng for this season’s trainers’ championship attests, along with the victories of Danny Shum’s Romantic Warrior, this policy has been extremely successful. Likewise in Vincent Ho and the up-and-coming Angus Chung, winner of this year’s Tony Cruz Award, we have outstanding riding talent.

I would also like to highlight the significant effort the Club has made to improve horse and human welfare. With thoroughbreds at the centre of everything we do, their safety, together with that of those who ride and care for them, is critical to the Club’s success. This is why, in response to rising summer temperatures, the Club implemented twilight meetings for the last seven day meetings of the season, just as we did last year.

To strengthen support for equine welfare even more, the Club has implemented a number of additional measures. These include increased use of advanced diagnostic imaging to identify pre-fracture pathology, greater use of wearable technology in training to assess the racing performance of horses, expansion of the Club’s equine rehabilitation unit, and enhanced IT solutions in support of pre-race veterinary inspections.

The Club has also significantly advanced its care for retired horses. This includes launching a new racehorse aftercare programme, doubling the capacity of the retired horses re-training unit at Conghua Racecourse, developing an IT system to centralise and enhance the traceability of retired horses, and establishing an equine emergency welfare fund and associated protocols to ensure that retired Hong Kong horses can receive emergency assistance anywhere in the world.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement


Through the Hong Kong Jockey Club Equine Welfare Research Foundation, established in 2020 with an endowment of HK$600 million, the Club is funding cutting-edge research designed to improve the quality of life of thoroughbred racehorses during and after their racing careers. Most recently, the foundation made a significant contribution to the Global Summit on Equine Safety & Technology organised by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities. This focused on international efforts to address two fundamental horse welfare issues impacting racing – catastrophic breakdowns and exercise associated sudden death.

 Strengthening our Customer-Centricity



Customer-centricity has always been central to the Club. But given the fundamental shift in consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic environment we need to go much deeper to understand, connect with and earn the loyalty of our customers, especially Gen Y and Gen Z, who are the customers of the future. In other words, to be more customer-centric we need to be more data-centric.

We have therefore developed a holistic way to register and listen to the voice of our customers and members, leveraging data analytical capabilities and AI to understand their value and needs. We have established a C360 data platform and analytics to provide a single view of customers. We have also developed a customer value management system which recognises the value a customer creates for the Club via horse ownership, spending in the ecosystem, as well as racing and football wagering spend. This will guide our investment and our customer segment strategies, with the aim of creating targeted value propositions.

Fundamental to attracting and retaining customers is the live experience of racing, which is only obtainable at the racecourse. Here the post-Covid effect continues to impact attendance on regular race days, though we have also been highly successful in driving attendance through our revamped Happy Wednesday and through sportainment programming on major racedays such as the LONGINES Hong Kong International Races and the BMW Hong Kong Derby.

Through our expanded offerings for Mainland visitors, especially in cooperation with the China Travel Service, we have also attracted record numbers of Mainland racegoers.

 Expanding the Club’s Global Wagering Footprint



Building on the success of commingling, our vision is to establish Hong Kong as the global hub for wagering on the world’s top races. This process is already well underway via the World Pool.

Fundamental to its success has been the simulcasting of overseas racing into Hong Kong. Thanks to HKSAR Government support, from December we have added additional simulcasts and we hope to add more.

Looking forward our aim is for the World Pool to cover all of the LONGINES World’s Top 100 Group 1 Races. We have also developed a Racing and Wagering Information protocol which will revolutionise pari-mutuel betting and enable us to offer even more bet types, further driving growth next year.

All of this means that Hong Kong has the unique opportunity to be the global race wagering hub, similar to one of the financial hubs.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement

However, as the Club expands globally, we also have to recognise that illegal gambling continues to be a major threat. Indeed it is expanding at a far faster pace than legal gambling, with illegal operators having no constraints when it comes to rolling out new products and bet types.

The Club’s success, therefore, in securing approval from the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau for new football bet types and competitions this year was essential. Six new bet types were launched in time for major international tournaments in June, including Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024, while the rest will be rolled out in phases in 2024/25.

Nonetheless, given the huge growth in illegal betting on sports not legally available in Hong Kong, the Club is of the view that a strong case can be made to extend its licence to other forms of sports betting, especially basketball betting. Only by doing so can we channel lost wagering dollars into legal channels, to the ultimate benefit of the community.

We will therefore continue to keep the HKSAR Government fully informed of the scope and scale of illegal betting, though we fully recognise that any expansion of sports betting is for the Government to decide and we will follow its lead.

 Racing Vision 2030 2030

As outlined in my statement last year, the Club’s Racing Vision 2030 is to bring world-class racing to the Greater Bay Area through its triangle of racecourses at Conghua, Sha Tin and Happy Valley. Our strategy is anchored in the national polices outlined in the National Equine Industry Development Plan 2020-25, which provides a framework for developing a high-quality equine industry in the Mainland.

Following the signing of a Framework Cooperation Agreement with the Guangzhou Municipal Government in 2021, under which we have agreed to jointly develop the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Racing Economic Cluster, and with the full endorsement of the HKSAR Government, the Club will launch regular racing at Conghua Racecourse in 2026. This is being supported by the Guangdong-Hong Kong Equine Industry Collaboration Task Force, of which the Club is an expert member.

 In preparation, we have made substantial progress in constructing an iconic grandstand designed by world-renowned architects Herzog & de Meuron.

With a strong focus on sustainability, the new grandstand will have 20,000 solar panels generating more than one-third of its annual electricity demand. A key feature will be a visitor experience centre offering an immersive and interactive environment to engage with equine culture and horse racing.

Indeed, with horse racing being so new to the Mainland, our key focus over the next few years will be to cultivate interest in horse racing as a sport and an appreciation of horse culture in all aspects. This includes developing a new generation of Mainland horse owners. It is with them in mind, and also to share more about the Club’s unique community role with Mainland partners, that we will be opening the new HKJC Shenzhen Centre later this year.

I should, however, stress that our vision for Conghua goes well beyond racing. Rather, we want to develop it as a centre of racing and equine excellence, for example through providing vocational training, veterinary science development and integrity training. We also want Conghua to become a gateway for Mainland-bred horses to achieve an internationally recognised health status sufficient to participate in international sporting events, including in Hong Kong. Here, our development of Conghua as the first internationally recognised equine disease-free zone in the Mainland has been instrumental. So too is our recent acquisition of land to develop an equine transfer centre.

In fact equine sport and the equine industry is flourishing not just in the Greater Bay Area but across the Mainland, where it can be a major contributor to the revitalisation of rural areas and a driver of economic growth. Potentially this includes everything from breeding, to training, to veterinary care, to sport events, to the supply of feedstuffs and related infrastructure.

Therefore, while the Greater Bay Area is the anchor for the Club’s activities, we also continue to engage with and support equine industry development at the national level. Last August, for example, I led a high-level delegation of the International Horse Sports Confederation as its Chairman on its first-ever tour of the Mainland, meeting with key officials at both national and provincial level.

The Club has also renewed its longstanding collaboration with the China Horse Industry Association and the Chinese Equestrian Association, signing supplemental agreements with both organisations. And following our support for the equestrian events of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, we were pleased to provide technical support for the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, for which we were honoured to be recognised as an “Outstanding Contributor”.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement


 Standing with our Community



As I have mentioned, despite the 11.0 decline in the Club’s wagering income, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust approved a record HK$10.2 billion in donations this year in support of 173 charity and community projects. To fund these donations, we had to draw on the Club’s and the Trust’s reserves, which will likely continue for some time to come. Nonetheless we recognise the vital need to support our community through these difficult times.

Mindful of this need, this year we launched large-scale projects targeting the elderly, young people, inter-generational poverty and health and mental well-being. Hence JC PROJECT LIFT aims to help low-income families in transitional housing break out of the poverty cycle. The JC PHARM+ Community Medication Service Network provides accessible and affordable community dispensing services, medication management and consulting services. The JC Carer Space Project provides holistic support to carers looking after the elderly. JC Project Bonfire supports the whole-person development of children in residential care, while JC Project MuSE provides music and sports education to underprivileged primary school children. In addition, through a new “whole-of-Trust” initiative, eight projects will target the mental health needs of young people and the city’s growing population of elderly.

All of these, I should stress, join long-running initiatives through which we seek to move the needle across a wide range of social issues. Several have already successfully transitioned to the mainstream, including being taken up by the HKSAR Government.

Nothing the Club does, however, would be possible without a strong partnership with the agencies who operate at the front line of social welfare. Here we are especially mindful of the needs of smaller agencies, who often lack the visibility to attract funding or the means to build the capacity they need to maximise their impact. To address this issue, the Trust has approved a new funding scheme that will broaden its reach to some 200 smaller agencies.

Globally Impactful Philanthropy

As the Chairman has elaborated in greater detail, the Institute of Philanthropy (IoP), which was launched this year, marks a major milestone for the Club’s charitable commitment. Conceived as an independent “think-fund-do” tank, it is dedicated to working with national, regional and global stakeholders for the betterment of societies everywhere.

The IoP is a culmination of the Club’s development over the last 20 years. A realisation that with the Club now being a global racing and wagering brand, with over 20 of its racing wagering turnover derived from outside of Hong Kong, it is both timely and appropriate that our philanthropy takes on a more global aspect. We also saw that global health and the consequences of climate change can only be tackled by joining hands regionally and globally.

The IoP has already entered into important partnerships relating to climate change and epidemic preparedness. We look forward to sharing more about the IoP’s goals and activities at the upcoming Philanthropy for Better Cities Forum 2024.

 Membership with a Racing Heart

Despite very difficult times for the hospitality industry, the Club continues to invest in the membership experience and we are very pleased to see that members appreciate this, with visitation across all clubhouses up on last year. In particular Happy Valley New Clubhouse, with its unique and differentiated dining and recreation offerings, is increasingly popular.

Indeed, thanks to our significant investment in the past and our extremely dedicated service staff, the membership club has been able to weather the difficulties of the past year in much better shape, with catering revenue holding up extremely well. That said, membership operations have experienced severe cost pressures, especially to retain and attract new staff, which have been only partially offset through subscription and entrance fees. Here it is important to understand that Membership is a separate company within the Club, with its own profit and loss statement.

34
---

 Chief Executive Officer’s Statement



Nonetheless, I would like to reassure members that we will continue to invest in creating an even better membership experience. This includes the new second floor at Sha Tin Clubhouse, currently under renovation, which follows the recent renovation of the entrance lobby. In August, a new swimming pool and fun pool will also open at Beas River Country Club.

Above all, we will continue to encourage and support members who want to fully engage with the sport of horse racing and in particular with horse ownership, which is, after all, the unique privilege of Club membership.

One Club, One Team, One Vision



Looking back over the past year I am once again struck by the enormous resilience of the Club. Having taken everything that the pandemic had to throw at us, and now also having to contend with the downturn, we have continued to deliver outstanding racing entertainment and the strongest support for our community. Above all we continue to expand our global influence and impact through the quality of our horses, the innovation of our wagering and the vision of our charitable commitment.

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Board of Stewards, most especially our Chairman Michael Lee, for their leadership and support over the past year. A special thank you to my colleagues in the management team and to all our employees, both full time and part time, whose passion and dedication has contributed so much to the success of the Club over the past year. Your commitment to the Club’s purpose and to “One Club, One Team, One Vision” is an inspiration, and I am deeply thankful to you all for your hard work on behalf of the Club.

The Institute of Philanthropy (IoP) is a major new initiative by the Club and its Charities Trust, an independent “think-fund-do” platform that brings global stakeholders together to promote the betterment of societies everywhere.

First announced at the 2023 Philanthropy for Better Cities Forum, the IoP builds on the Club’s decades of strategic philanthropy. It is motivated by an awareness that social issues are increasingly complex and require cross-sectoral, cross-disciplinary and even cross-border solutions.

The IoP also aligns with the Club’s own development. With the Club now deriving over 20 of its racing wagering turnover from overseas, it is timely and appropriate to join hands with foundations and institutions from the Mainland and around the world to address some of the key social issues of our time.

A Leading “Think-Fund-Do” Tank for China and Asia

 （）

The IoP’s mission is to become a leading “think-fund-do” tank for China and Asia and a platform for global stakeholders to work together for the betterment of societies everywhere. It is dedicated to promoting philanthropic thought leadership and enhancing sector capabilities at local, regional and global levels in collaboration with fellow funders.

The IoP is supported with an approved donation of HK$6.8 billion from the Club and the Charities Trust.

In just its first ten months, the IoP has entered into important partnerships relating to climate change, epidemic preparedness and national heritage conservation. It also garnered national recognition at the 10th China Philanthropy Annual Conference of the China Charity Alliance, when its establishment was named one of the country’s Top Ten Philanthropy events of 2023.

 Strengthening Global Health and Resilience to Climate Change



The IoP is collaborating with multiple partners at the global level to address the impact of climate change on the health of vulnerable populations.



At COP28, on the occasion of the first-ever Health Day, the IoP signed a formal statement of collaboration with the Rockefeller Foundation to work jointly towards this end.

28（COP28）（Rockefeller Foundation）

At the 77th World Health Assembly, the IoP participated in the launch of Investment Round – a new mechanism to mobilise sustainable financing for the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Fourteenth General Programme of Work, 2025-2028. The IoP announced a first tranche donation of HK$9.6 million to support the WHO’s efforts to safeguard the health of migrant and displaced populations affected by climate change.

7720252028960

Also at the World Health Assembly, the IoP partnered with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to co-sponsor a side event in support of the Global Health Emergency Corps (GHEC). The GHEC was launched by the WHO and its partners at the 76th World Health Assembly to strengthen collaboration and emergency response levels across countries and health networks.

•（Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation）76（Global Health Emergency Corps）

 Epidemic Preparedness and Prevention



Recognising that COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic, and that infectious diseases respect no borders, the IoP has partnered with the Club’s Charities Trust to provide HK$3 billion in support of preparedness and prevention initiatives announced in the HKSAR Chief Executive’s 2023 Policy Address.

302023

The Charities Trust has partnered with the University of Hong Kong, the University of Cambridge and the International Vaccine Institute to establish the global headquarters of the new Hong Kong Jockey Club Global Health Institute. This is the city’s first institution dedicated to bringing the latest translational vaccine technology to Hong Kong.


---

In an initiative with both local and regional implications, the Charities Trust has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Health Bureau of the HKSAR Government to strengthen local infectious disease prevention and preparedness, and to enhance co-operation in the Greater Bay Area. Specifically, this will support the Health Bureau and the Centre for Health Protection in emerging disease surveillance and prevention, epidemic response capacity building, and emerging disease preparedness and research.

At the national level, the IoP has signed two co-operation agreements with the National Health Commission to support the Healthy China 2030 Planning Outline. Under these, the IoP will contribute to the development of health talent in clinical services and health management, and help build the capacity of top medical and healthcare professionals.

 Arts and Heritage Conservation with the Palace Museum

Building on the Club’s strong track record of heritage conservation at Tai Kwun, as well as its HK$3.5 billion donation to construct the Hong Kong Palace Museum, the IoP has signed a memorandum of co-operation with the Palace Museum. Some HK$440 million will be donated by the IoP to promote Chinese culture and values in Hong Kong, the Mainland and worldwide, and to support talent development in the arts technology and cultural sectors.

A key initiative will be the establishment of The Palace Museum Hong Kong Cultural Exchange Hub at the Palace Museum in Beijing. This will involve restoring and conserving the historic Chengqiangong and organising thematic exhibitions and cultural exchanges between young arts tech talent in Hong Kong and the Mainland. There will also be support for touring exhibitions, digital exhibitions and capacity building.

Hong Kong racing enjoyed a memorable year with the Club hosting spectacular international race meetings and horses excelling both at home and abroad. This, together with a strong line-up of live performances and on-course activities, brought many new racegoers to the tracks. Meanwhile, the Club forged ahead with preparations for the start of regular racing at Conghua in 2026.

2026

 Racing the World

The 2023/24 season was another exciting chapter for Hong Kong’s world-class racing. The city’s two flagship international events, the LONGINES Hong Kong International Races and FWD Champions Day, attracted a total of 32 overseas runners from five countries, with Hong Kong prevailing in six out of seven Group 1 races.

Hong Kong horses also excelled overseas. Hong Kong Champion Middle-Distance Horse Romantic Warrior had an exceptional campaign, claiming the Group 1 W.S. Cox Plate in Australia before sweeping to victory in the Group 1 Yasuda Kinen in Japan. California Spangle captured the Group 1 Al Quoz Sprint in Dubai, while Victor The Winner ran a brave third in the Group 1 Takamatsunomiya Kinen in Japan.

Looking forward, the Club is well-advanced in its preparations for the beginning of regular racing at Conghua Racecourse in Guangzhou in 2026. This year saw the completion of three more stable blocks in Conghua, taking its total capacity to 1,070 horses, while the number of dual-site stables rose from 15 to 18. Work is also well advanced on an iconic new grandstand. Meanwhile, stables refurbishment got underway at Sha Tin.

 Leadership in International Racing



The Club plays a leading role in world racing through its participation in the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA), the Asian Racing Federation (ARF) and the International Horse Sports Confederation (IHSC).



The Club’s CEO is Chair of the IFHA, Chairman of the ARF and President of the IHSC, while nine of the Club’s executives hold senior positions in the IFHA and ARF.



The Club also hosts the secretariats of both the ARF and its Council on Anti-Illegal Betting and Related Financial Crime, and leads the work of the IFHA Executive Office and IHSC Secretariat.



In October, the Club’s CEO chaired the 57th International Conference of Horseracing Authorities (ICHA) in Paris, with over 40 jurisdictions participating.

2023105740

In his keynote address, the CEO focused on the importance of equine welfare to the industry’s long-term sustainability.



Meanwhile, the International Conference for the Health, Safety and Welfare of Jockeys, held in conjunction with the ICHA, focused on some of the latest issues affecting the physical and mental wellness of jockeys.



During the year, the ARF continued to bring members together through its comprehensive engagement plan.



The ARF Council on Anti-Illegal Betting and Related Financial Crime also built awareness of the changing landscape and growing threat of illegal gambling, publishing two major studies.



In August, the Club’s CEO, in his capacity as IHSC President, led a delegation of senior representatives on a visit to Beijing, Hangzhou and Guangzhou.

This is the IHSC's first ever Mainland trip, highlighting its commitment to understanding, supporting and contributing to the Mainland’s equine industry.

 Ownership



The investment owners make in purchasing high-quality horses is the bedrock of the Club’s world-class racing. The Club is therefore constantly reviewing its policies to improve the ownership experience. Over the past decade, for example, the Club has incentivised owners with an almost 100 increase in prize money, with HK$1.73 billion in prize money and other incentives offered over the past racing season.

In light of the challenging economic circumstances, from next season the Club will invest HK$140 million to lower the cost of ownership. The basic monthly livery fee for each horse in training will be cut from HK$38,200 to HK$30,000 per month. Additionally, for the first four months after arrival of an imported horse, the basic monthly livery fee will be further reduced by HK$5,000 to HK$25,000.

The Club will also provide increased financial support for owners to export their racehorses after retirement. From next season, owners will receive a payment of HK$50,000 towards this cost, in addition to the existing travel subsidy of up to HK$100,000.

Through the Ownership 2.0 strategy, the Club is working to enhance the ownership experience for both seasoned and first-time owners. This includes offering seminars, webinars and other live events on such subjects as permit types, balloting, horse purchase and pedigree confirmation. Advisory services have also been extended to Mainland and international members as the Club seeks to expand its pool of owners.

Through the Hong Kong International Sale, the Club provides owners with the opportunity to purchase quality thoroughbreds. In March, 14 lots went under the hammer, the highest price being HK$5.4 million for Lot 20 by Starspangledbanner out of Wowcha.

The most coveted prize on the domestic racing calendar, with a history dating back to 1873, the BMW Hong Kong Derby puts the city’s strongest four-year-olds to the test in a quest for “once-in-a-lifetime glory”. The raceday got off to a lively start with a singing performance by MC Cheung in the Sha Tin parade ring, while actor Donnie Yen brought star quality as the event’s ambassador.

The race more than lived up to expectations as Massive Sovereign, making only his second start in Hong Kong after winning on his debut, soared to one of the most remarkable Derby triumphs to date. It was a first Derby win for Dennis Yip, while Zac Purton collected his second success in the contest. Massive Sovereign clocked the fastest time in Hong Kong Derby history – 1m 59.85s – since the race distance was elevated to 2000m at the turn of the century.

 A Year of Champions



Romantic Warrior made history by winning an unmatched five Group

His top-level exploits included historic victories in Australia’s W.S. Cox Plate and Japan’s Yasuda Kinen, plus a trio of local triumphs in the LONGINES Hong Kong Cup, Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup and FWD QEII Cup, also earning the star galloper the Champion Middle-Distance Horse title. As an eight-time Group 1 winner from 20 appearances, with HK$151.92 million banked, there was little doubt Romantic Warrior would also be named Most Popular Horse.

 Crowned Champion Miler in the past three years, Golden Sixty

 scooped a fourth successive title for his dazzling victory in the LONGINES Hong Kong Mile, a performance acclaimed as one of his best ever, especially after jumping from the widest of 14 barriers as an eight-year-old and following a lengthy 224 days between runs.

California Spangle reverted to sprinting and quickly reignited his career for a pair of Group 1 wins in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Cup and Dubai’s Al Quoz Sprint, earning him the Champion Sprinter award. He also claimed the Group 2 Sha Tin Trophy first-up.





Dubbed Most Improved Horse and Champion Griffin, Ka Ying Rising won five races in his first season in Hong Kong, earning him a 59-point rating rise. The three-year-old capped the campaign with a rousing victory in the Group 3 Sha Tin Vase.

Five G Patch’s stamina proved him worthy of recognition as Champion Stayer. Although not a winner this campaign, his runner-up finish behind Godolphin’s globetrotting Group 1 star Rebel’s Romance in the Standard Chartered Champions & Chater Cup in May was a highlight.





Among this season’s bright young stars was Galaxy Patch, who was named Champion Four-Year-Old. The emerging talent won six races, including a pair at Group 3 level: the Lion Rock Trophy and Premier Plate.

Best known as the trainer of Golden Sixty, Francis Lui crowned a superb season with 70 wins to land his first Champion Trainer award following a gripping tussle with Pierre Ng that was decided only in the final race of the season.

Racecourse Entertainment
With Hong Kong well and truly back after the pandemic, the Club went all out to engage and re-engage racing fans with the excitement of live racing.

At Happy Valley, the Club offered free entry from September to December in support of the HKSAR Government’s “Night Vibes” campaign, while the ever-popular Beer Garden introduced new zones, pop-up installations and food trucks providing unique and Instagramable experiences. Under the Race Happy banner, racegoers were entertained with month-long themes including Oktoberfest, Race In Style, Winter Wonderland, Happy French Wednesday and a celebration of music festivals from around the world. Overall, the Race Happy campaign increased social media engagement with Happy Valley race meetings by over 50.

At Sha Tin, the Club’s efforts to drive attendance during major racedays paid off. Especially appreciated were pre-race opening performances by popular celebrities.

on 1 January Lucky Start Raceday, MC Cheung on BMW Hong Kong Derby day and Hins Cheung on FWD Champions Day. Fan club members were engaged via the Digital Zone, with tailored edutainment programmes on the sport of horse racing.

A day at the races is becoming increasingly popular with Mainland tourists eager for a unique Hong Kong experience. By collaborating with influencers on popular social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and WeChat, and creating engaging racing sports content and tailored on-course experiences, the Club saw significant growth in Mainland tourist numbers at Sha Tin. An average of 3,000 attended major racedays, with a record of over 6,300 enjoying the season finale meeting.

The Racecourse Master Plan continues to provide new and upgraded venues, with work starting this year on a new Members Main Entrance at Sha Tin. Looking to the future, and especially with Gen Y and Z in mind, the Club is developing a digital racecourse concept, providing new ways to enrich the live racegoing experience. This will be piloted at the new-look adrenaline at Happy Valley next season.

 Celebrating our Racing Passion

What distinguishes membership of the Club is the opportunity to be part of a world-class racing community and to enjoy the pleasure of owning and racing horses, which is the exclusive privilege of members.

It is a pleasure we celebrated at this year’s Members’ Day at Sha Tin Racecourse. Under the theme “Celebrating our Racing Passion”, there were a variety of on-course experiences and a luncheon attended by prominent, new and prospective horse owners.

No less celebratory were the gala evenings for the BMW Hong Kong Derby and FWD Champions Day, which brought leading horse owners and international guests to The Hilltop in The Valley.

To further build interest and excitement around racing, a variety of racing experience and educational programmes were held throughout the year, including horse owner sharing sessions.

Curated trips to overseas racecourses also provided members with the opportunity to broaden their appreciation for the sport, whilst also facilitating connections among racing enthusiasts.

At the racecourses, the ongoing Racecourse Master Plan continues to provide new and upgraded facilities for members. This includes the remodelling of the Members Main Entrance at Sha Tin Racecourse for greater convenience and a much-improved arrival experience. Work commenced this season and is scheduled for completion late next year. This follows the opening last season of a substantially larger members’ car park.

 The Lifestyle of Racing




The lifestyle of racing encompasses not only a passion for racing but the pursuit of related lifestyle experiences and the opportunity to contribute to the Club’s purpose: the betterment of our society. This year, the Club took further strides to create unique lifestyle programmes for members and to foster connections that unite members around shared interests.

One example is the Racing Masterclass Series at The Eighth. This represents a fresh approach to racing education, with a focus on engaging young members and nurturing future owners. The comprehensive programming spans various topics inspired by the current Racing 101 curriculum, providing a better understanding of local horse racing, and has undergone successful trials at The Eighth.

As more members welcomed the Members’ Mobile App, the Club continued to enhance its convenience, incorporating new features to provide an even more immersive digital experience.

Members can now make raceday table reservations and update raceday attendance records through the app. Additional new features include reservation of gym studio classes and ordering of food and beverages at selected dine-in venues.

To further enhance connectivity with members as well as to promote sustainability, the members’ monthly badges magazine has been transformed into an interactive digital version called badges Edit. Complementing the digital version is a new high-quality print edition, published twice a year.

The Club believes that the Greater Bay Area has huge potential to develop a world-class equine industry. As part of this, preparations are well in hand for regular racing at the Club’s Conghua Racecourse in Guangzhou, which will commence in 2026.

Also well advanced is the Club’s new HKJC Shenzhen Centre, which will open early next season. This will be an important brand platform to share information about equine sports and the Club’s charity mission, and will be a meeting place for members, guests and thought leaders from across the Greater Bay Area.

Through fostering strong connections both in Hong Kong and internationally, the Club has ensured consistent engagement with its customers, guaranteeing a seamless experience even during challenging times. This year, the Club has continued to provide wagering excellence, introducing new football and racing wagering services. By harnessing the power of commingling, simulcasting and the World Pool, Hong Kong has solidified its position as the global hub for top-tier international racing.

 Performance



Despite strong engagement with the Club’s high-quality racing wagering events, Hong Kong customers were not immune to weak economic sentiment and higher levels of cross-border travel in the post-COVID period. However, lower levels of local racing wagering turnover were partly offset by the continued growth of international commingling and the World Pool, which grew 13.7 and 57.1 respectively. Total racing wagering turnover for the year was down 3.1 to HK$136.1 billion and for the season down 4.5 to HK$134.7 billion.

Football wagering benefited from a year of attractive football and popular tournaments, including the Women’s World Cup, the Asian Cup, the African Cup of Nations and the first stages of Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024. Alongside effective product marketing, new wagering products such as Early Settlement and Same Game All-up enhanced the customer experience, while starting from October football wagering was available 24/7. This contributed to an all-time high for football wagering turnover, up 2.2 to HK$160.3 billion.

Mark Six lottery customers enjoyed larger jackpot draws this year due to a favourable sequence of jackpot rollovers and seven Snowball draws. In particular, the Chinese New Year Snowball draw, with a record estimated First Division Prize Fund of HK$118 million, drew strong customer support. A new targeted social media strategy to increase customer awareness of jackpots and Snowballs was also successful. As a result, Mark Six turnover was up 13.3 for the year to HK$8.5 billion.

 Commingling



It was another record-breaking year for commingling on Hong Kong racing, with turnover for the season up 13.7 to HK$28.8 billion, representing 23.7 of total local racing wagering turnover for the season.

13.728823.7

This performance can be attributed to the introduction of new commingling partners, the expansion of co-operation with existing partners, and a continued diversification of the customer base.



In all, more than 70 partners from 26 countries and jurisdictions participated in commingling on Hong Kong racing, including Malaysia for the first time.

A notable highlight was achieved at the LONGINES Hong Kong International Races, with commingling turnover surging by 24.3 to HK$429.6 million, setting a new record for a ten-race card.

 Simulcasting



Hong Kong fans were able to enjoy more of the world’s finest races this season, thanks to the HKSAR Government’s approval in December of additional simulcasts. This allows for up to 12 races (up from 9) on any one simulcast day and an annual total of 25 simulcast races (up from 10) as part of a local Hong Kong raceday. Overall, the Club offered 368 simulcast races in 2023/24, a 23 increase on the 299 offered during the previous 12 months.

The simulcast schedule focused on showcasing the world’s Top 100 Group 1/Grade 1 races, highlighting the global nature of Hong Kong wagering. Races such as the Tattersalls Gold Cup in Ireland, the Stradbroke Handicap in Australia and the Durban July in South Africa were added alongside South America’s richest race, the Gran Premio Latinoamericano. In total, 61 overseas races that had been in the Top 100 at least once in the previous three years were simulcast during the season. As a result, overall turnover on simulcasting for the season, including World Pool commingling, rose by 8.7 to HK$12.8 billion.

 World Pool

Created by the Club, the World Pool offers global parimutuel wagering with deep liquidity on the very best international racing. This season, the spectacular growth of World Pool wagering continued apace, with the number of World Pool races increasing from 175 to 258. Commingling turnover into the World Pool was up by 57.1 on last season.

A noteworthy milestone was the expansion of the World Pool in Australia with 57 races added, including The Everest, the Caulfield Cup and both days of The Championships and the W.S. Cox Plate. The latter held special significance for Hong Kong fans, who saw Romantic Warrior become not only the first Hong Kong horse to win the W.S. Cox Plate but also the first Hong Kong winner of an overseas World Pool race.

To further promote World Pool wagering, the Club introduced a larger and more captivating Moment of the Year and a new Jockeys Championship in the UK and Ireland, with £50,000 going to the winning jockey’s charity of choice. Driven by diverse strategies tailored to different markets, World Pool wagering is increasingly recognised as a global brand representing the very best of international racing.

 Customer Centricity and Connectivity



The decline in local racing wagering turnover this year underlined that the Club must constantly engage and re-engage with its customer base, not least Gen Y and Gen Z, who are the customers of the future.

YZ

The Club has therefore embarked on a wholesale exercise, leveraging analytics and AI, to develop an integrated view of customer needs and satisfaction at every stage of their journey. The aim is to build differentiated value propositions which will guide the design and delivery of the end-to-end customer experience.



To this end, the Club is building a data-driven platform, with customer preferences stored in a centralised Enterprise Data Analytics Platform (EDAP). This will be the engine for segmentation and for providing personalised services to customers. It will also support data analytics for management decision making.

(EDAP)

A key focus is the online-to-offline experience. In other words, engaging customers not only digitally but via live and social experiences that enable them to fully enjoy the excitement of racing.

 Responsible Gambling Policy

The Club’s support for responsible gambling is implemented through a wide range of measures under its Responsible Gambling Policy. These include underage access controls at betting premises, prohibition of credit betting, dissemination of responsible gambling messages and training for all front-line betting staff. These measures are constantly refined and developed.

The Club was vigilant both before and during Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024, disseminating responsible gambling messages across a wide range of platforms, including social media, newspapers, radio and public transport. In 2023, the Club also launched a ten-episode TV series entitled “Illegal Bookmaking Exposed” to arouse public awareness of illegal betting and responsible gambling.

The Club is fully committed to supporting the Government-managed Ping Wo Fund, which supports responsible gambling education, counselling and treatment services as well as conducting gambling related studies and research. As of mid-2024, the fund had received HK$586 million from the Club. From 2025/26 to 2026/27, the Club will increase its contributions to HK$50 million per year.

The Club’s efforts and achievements are widely recognised. Notably, in 2021, the Club was again awarded the highest level of accreditation under the Responsible Gaming Framework of the World Lottery Association. The Club is the first operator in Asia to receive this recognition four times in succession since 2011.

Building on this success, the Club has assisted the China Sports Lottery Administration Centre (CSLAC) to develop its Responsible Gaming Framework at both national and provincial levels in the Mainland. Having achieved Level 3 accreditations under the Responsible Gaming Framework of the World Lottery Association in 2018 and 2021, the CSLAC was awarded the highest Level 4 accreditation in December 2023.

 Youth Education



Preventive education for young people is another major focus of the Club’s responsible gambling initiatives. Working together with non-governmental organisations, the Club has launched programmes to help young people develop healthy habits and positive values like self-restraint and responsibility. These include the FiNet Mind Programme, launched in 2023 in partnership with The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, which promotes cyber wellness and financial management to over 2,300 students from 22 secondary schools.

In May, the Club launched its first responsible gambling programme in a tertiary institution, sponsoring the Dean’s Cup Business Innovation Gymnasium 9.0, a business competition organised by the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Centre of Hong Kong Baptist University. The Club highlighted the importance of social responsibility in entrepreneurship and shared its responsible gambling messaging and financial management concepts from the FiNet Mind Programme.

 Illegal Betting:

 The Time for Action is Now



Illegal betting in Hong Kong surged during the pandemic as stay-at-home bettors sought alternate forms of online entertainment and were aggressively targeted by illegal operators via social media.

It is now clear that this increase was not temporary, but has become an existential threat to the tens of billions in tax and charity funding which legal betting generates for Hong Kong every year.

Last year alone an estimated 562,000 Hong Kong people used illegal operators - up 5 on the year before. Total illegal turnover was HK$339 to HK$355 billion - more than the HK$304.8 billion bet through legal channels. 562,00053,3903,5503,048

The massive profits go to hundreds of illegal betting operators and can be used to fund drug trafficking, cyber-scams and other illegal enterprises run by local and transnational organised crime.

These impacts have real-world effects on Hong Kong in terms of criminality, corruption of sport and social impacts such as increased gambling harm. Examples include the 2024 arrests of three local football players for allegedly facilitating illegal betting on and corruption of Hong Kong Premier league football matches, and the arrests in 2023 of a criminal syndicate for allegedly laundering HK$240 million derived from illegal online betting. 2024202324,000

Meanwhile, gambling counselling organisations have seen more and more young people getting involved in online illegal betting including on sports such as basketball, e-sports and online casino games. As a consequence they become victims of gambling harm and loan sharks.

However, the illegal market continues to offer many advantages over the legal market. It pays zero tax, so can offer better prices (odds). It has no licence restrictions, so can offer credit betting on many more products (sports and bet types). Survey data shows that the biggest driver of illegal betting are sports not legally available for betting, such as basketball and tennis.

The Club continues to take direct action where possible against illegal bookmaking in Hong Kong, closely collaborating with local stakeholders such as the Hong Kong Police Force, and internationally through organisations such as the Asian Racing Federation to raise awareness of illegal betting and its negative social impact.

But it is no exaggeration to say the threat from illegal betting has never been greater. No one stakeholder can tackle this issue alone, though allowing the legal market flexibility to compete on more equitable terms has proven to be an effective solution.

 Charities and Community

This was a landmark year for the Club’s commitment to the betterment of society. New initiatives were launched to address poverty, promote youth development, support the elderly and strengthen epidemic preparedness. The Philanthropy for Better Cities Forum brought together international philanthropists to debate solutions to global inequity. Above all, the new Institute of Philanthropy was launched with the mission to promote philanthropic thought leadership locally, regionally and globally.

All of this was made possible by the Club’s unique integrated business model through which racing and wagering generate tax contributions, charity support and employment opportunities for the community. In 2023/24, the Club donated 93 of its operating surplus after tax to The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. In the same period, the Trust approved HK$10.2 billion in donations to support 173 charity and community projects. This included a special donation of HK$3.5 billion to the Institute of Philanthropy.

Full details of this year’s approved donations can be found on pages 106 to 124 of the Financial Report. Further information on the Institute of Philanthropy can be found on pages 36 to 39 of this report.

And two projects promote youth development: JC Project Bonfire cultivates the whole-person development of children in residential care; and JC Project MuSE provides music and sports education to underprivileged primary school children.

 New Initiatives for Mental Health

A new “whole-of-Trust” initiative was also launched to address the mental health challenges faced by young people and the city’s growing population of elderly. A total of HK$790 million has been approved to fund eight mental health projects that provide both online and offline emotional support at the primary care, school and community levels. Territory-wide monitoring will also be carried out to measure impact. The projects are expected to benefit more than 154,000 people.

 Project



Trust-initiated Project



The Jockey Club Age-friendly City Project is designed to foster

an age-friendly Hong Kong. Taking as its reference the eight

domains of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) age-friendly city

framework, it has adopted a bottom-up, district-based approach

and multi-sector collaboration, bringing together District Councils,

the HKSAR Government, NGOs, the business sector, academia and

other community stakeholders.



This year, the team has focused on sharing learning, producing a

case book and contributing to the WHO Global Database of Age-

friendly Practices for reference by policymakers and practitioners.

To sustain the project’s momentum, the business sector will be

encouraged and empowered to adopt age-friendly measures

through recognition and capacity building programmes.

Jockey Club Community eHealth
 Care Project

 Trust-initiated Project

The Jockey Club Community eHealth Care Project is the first territory-wide elderly care project to integrate digital health management technology, community care and professional support. The aim is to support chronic disease management and the healthy ageing of older people. Elderly centres are being developed as a first point of contact, with digital technology utilised to raise health awareness and for self-management. Data derived from the project will be utilised for broader data analytics.

Now in its third and final phase, 157 elderly centres are participating, a 60 increase on phase two. Encouragingly, more NGOs are engaging with the project, installing eHealth stations, empowering frontline staff to assess the health and social needs of the elderly, and organising health programmes.

 Trust-initiated Project



CLAP@JC is Hong Kong’s cross-sector platform for youth career and life development (CLD). Bringing together educational, business and community resources, it aims to empower young people to embrace multiple pathways to success, to develop a positive and hopeful outlook on life, and to ready themselves to contribute to society.

．

Now in its ninth year, the tools and methodologies pioneered by CLAP@JC are becoming firmly embedded institutionally and within the wider ecosystem. The Education Bureau has adopted CLAP@JC’s online learning portal to provide CLD assessment and teaching materials in secondary schools, while the Hong Kong Benchmarks for Career & Life Development (HKBM©) self-assessment tool will be introduced from the 2025 school year.

．2025(HKBM©)

Two additional district-based CLD networks have been developed, taking the total to seven, while the CV360® has been shared with over 2,000 human resources managers.

2,000CV360®

The project’s achievements were shared at the CLAP@JC Conference in March, with research findings being presented at two Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) conferences in June 2023 and May 2024. Significantly, the CV360® is now listed on the OECD Observatory on Digital technologies in Career guidance for Youth as an example of best practice.

 JC PROJECT LIFT



The five-year JC PROJECT LIFT programme aims to help families living in transitional housing break out of the poverty trap through enhancing family capabilities and developing sustainable livelihoods. It is based on the successful Graduation Approach used in rural settings overseas but localised to address poverty in high-income urban environments as the Urban Graduation Approach.

JC PROJECT LIFT empowers families financially through a high-interest savings scheme, which incentivises saving habits and builds financial literacy. A pay-for-success employment centre seeks to improve employment aspirations and prospects by helping families explore job opportunities and develop their skills and knowledge. Just as importantly, the programme seeks to build confidence and self-esteem, encouraging families to expand their social circle and engage with the wider community.

Run in collaboration with 18 partners and with the support of the HKSAR Government’s Housing Bureau and Labour and Welfare Bureau, JC PROJECT LIFT is expected to benefit approximately 14,000 families across 25 transitional housing projects.

This year, the CARE@hkjc Volunteer Team recorded a record 25,000+ service hours and participated in a record 570 activities in close partnership with local organisations. Especially welcome were two new teams, the CARE Band, which provides musical entertainment, and CARE Painters, who offer face and hand painting at community events.

Showing their support for the environment, CARE volunteers joined a clean-up organised by Trailsweeper, pairing up with young people from ethnic minorities to clean trails between the Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery and Tao Fong Shan in Sha Tin. Other volunteers took part in the Green Earth Night Walk and in the Butterfly Marking Experiential Day at Siu Lang Shui Butterfly Habitat, where they learned about butterfly ecology and behavioural patterns.

The CARE team has long supported animal welfare. This year team members supported Hong Kong Dog Rescue’s fundraising walk from The Peak to Lan Kwai Fong, where CARE Painters also supported the fundraising efforts. CARE volunteers also supported the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ Christmas carnival in Wan Chai, which featured performances from the CARE team’s balloon twisters, face-painters and band.

With Hong Kong hosting several major sporting events over the year, CARE team volunteers have been on hand to help out. This included support for the Hong Kong 2023 World Boccia Asia-Oceania Regional Championships, the 2024 UCI Track Nations Cup and the Hong Kong Sevens, with the focus on helping the community engage with and enjoy these memorable sporting occasions.

 Enhancing Professional and Leadership Capabilities



This year, the Club re-defined employee competencies to include



customer-centricity, empathetic leadership and emotional



intelligence. These updated competencies are designed to enhance



the professional and leadership capabilities of employees in line



with the Club’s strategic goals as well as to support employees in



achieving their career objectives.



The new competencies were reflected in HR programmes and



processes to identify talent and facilitate employee development



including recruitment, personal development plans and leadership



development and assessment.



To strengthen leadership capabilities, the Club has introduced a two-



year People Management Excellence Programme for supervisory-



level employees. This year, the first cohort of 77 employees

77

graduated, with some 65 being promoted – contributing to the

65

Club’s leadership pipeline. The programme has been extended to



employees in the Mainland, helping to foster a Club-wide culture of



teamwork.



To foster a growth mindset, employees are encouraged to take

97

ownership of their own development. Some 97 of employees



at senior staff grade and above have established a personal



development plan, detailing their learning goals and milestones.

 Employee Engagement



Open communication is fundamental to the Club, especially to align employees with its goals and direction. The post-pandemic resumption of face-to-face biannual management briefings, bringing more than 700 senior employees together, was an important opportunity to share and discuss the Club’s strategy.

Also providing greater insights into the Club were “Dialogue with Leaders” sessions with senior management, with a cumulative attendance of 500 executives and assistant executives taking part in the interactive sessions, helping to enhance cross-divisional synergies and teamwork.

At divisional level, racecourse tours and leaders’ sharing sessions helped to strengthen employee understanding of operations and key industry topics. Informal meetings have also been organised between management and frontline employees at Off-Course Betting Branches to strengthen operational readiness and teamwork.

 Digitalising the Employee Journey



This year the Club launched the first phase of “ Pegasus”, a single unified platform that will ultimately manage all key HR processes including recruitment, onboarding, payroll, compensation management, talent management, performance management and HR analytics.

The first module – a digital learning system – was launched in April. This enables employees to search and register for classroom and online courses and to complete e-learning courses on their computers and mobile devices. More modules will be launched over the coming year.

Also helping to improve efficiency is a new HR electronic document management system. Meanwhile, all employment, onboarding, employee movement and benefits documents are now signed digitally. As a result of these two initiatives, document turnaround time has improved by up to 50.

This year, the Club worked hard to reduce and mitigate its environmental impact, support biodiversity and promote environmental best practices in the community. It also completed a waste baseline assessment of its Hong Kong operations and embarked on a comprehensive review of its sustainability strategy, aiming to deepen its understanding of the sustainability issues affecting the Club and the range of impacts the Club has externally. This will be the basis for a new sustainability strategy going forward.



Over the past year, the Club has made significant progress in defining its foundational plan for sustainability. This strategic roadmap represents the Club’s commitment to environmental stewardship. To support this plan, the Club has enhanced its sustainability governance and sustainability structure.

In order to ensure the Club’s approach to sustainability is comprehensive and well-informed, a double materiality assessment was conducted. This aims to validate current priorities and inform the development of a new sustainability strategy. It encompasses both environmental and social material issues and utilises a robust methodology that takes into account the Club’s impacts on society, the environment and the economy, as well as risks, opportunities and stakeholder perspectives.

Key environmental topics identified in the assessment include greenhouse gas emissions, renewables and energy use, circularity and sustainability governance. The Club is currently processing the outcomes of this materiality exercise to ensure they are aligned with stakeholder perceptions and needs. A materiality assessment for the Club’s Mainland operations is scheduled for 2024/25.

With the pandemic receding since 2023, the Club’s operations in Hong Kong have returned to normal. In addition the new IT Operations Building in Sha Tin commenced operations this year. As a result carbon emissions (Scope 1 & 2) in Hong Kong increased year on year by 7.1 to 106,433 tonnes of CO₂-e. Meanwhile, carbon emissions (Scope 1 & 2) for Mainland operations increased by 7.4 year on year to 21,852 tonnes of CO₂-e, mainly due to the gradual strengthening of operations and expansion of horse stabling capacity at Conghua Racecourse.

Building for the Future


For its property assets, the Club aims to integrate environmental considerations into every stage of a building’s life cycle. For new buildings, sustainability is a key consideration in their design, construction and operation, with recent examples being Sha Tin Communications and Technology Centre, Happy Valley New Clubhouse and Conghua Racecourse. A major project currently underway is the construction of a new grandstand and multi-level car park at Conghua Racecourse, which will feature a significant installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels.

Equally, the Club has made a considerable effort to improve the efficiency of its older building stock. For example, this year its achievements in improving the performance and energy efficiency of Sha Tin Racecourse grandstands, which are more than 40 years old, were recognised with awards by the HKSAR Government’s Energy Saving Championship Scheme, the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers Hong Kong Region, and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers Hong Kong Chapter.

Also this year, Tai Kwun, the former Central Police Station compound conserved and revitalised by the Club in partnership with the HKSAR Government, was certified as a BEAM Plus New Building V1.1 Final Gold by the Hong Kong Green Building Council. This is significant recognition of the Club’s commitment to sustainability in conserving this important heritage site.

 Operations Review



 Reducing Energy Consumption

Over the last ten years, the Club has done a great deal to reduce its energy consumption, notably through the installation of energy-efficient air-conditioning and lighting systems. Energy efficiency in office buildings, clubhouses and racecourses is optimised via the Club’s building management system, with a network of 85,000 monitoring and control points at racecourses. The Club nonetheless continues to work hard to improve its energy efficiency and to generate renewable energy.

Starting in 2022, floodlighting at both Hong Kong racecourses has been upgraded with LED technology. The upgrade at Happy Valley Racecourse, completed in August 2022, has achieved energy savings of approximately 28 on racedays. At Sha Tin Racecourse, the upgrade was completed in September 2023, with energy performance being monitored.

Following a pilot project at Happy Valley Racecourse in 2021, the Club is expanding the installation of solar PV panels to approximately 80 premises in Hong Kong. The project had achieved an installed capacity of approximately 1.9 megawatts by the first quarter of 2024, with the eventual goal being over 4 megawatts. Electricity generated contributes to the HKSAR Government’s Feed-in Tariff scheme.

At Conghua Racecourse, the new stable block PV panels became operational in February. PV panels are also being installed at the new Conghua staff quarters and should become operational later in 2024. Meanwhile, the new grandstand’s iconic roofs will feature the Club’s largest single building-integrated PV installation, aiming to generate over 2,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year.

In 2020, the Club launched a five-year energy savings plan in its Hong Kong clubhouses (except Happy Valley New Clubhouse, which was designed for a high level of energy efficiency). Energy-saving measures include retro-commissioning of air-conditioning systems, installation of LED lighting in back-of-house areas and automatic lighting controls to minimise energy waste in unoccupied areas. To further drive energy savings, and also to reduce water consumption, a reinforcement programme was launched for catering staff this year.

 Operations Review

Meanwhile, the Club is phasing out R22 refrigerant in all its air-conditioning systems with a view to adopting more sustainable cooling solutions. Over 600 air-conditioning units will be replaced by 2031/32.

 Electric Vehicles



The Club currently operates 64 electric or hybrid passenger vehicles in Hong Kong, representing 97 of its fleet in the city. As the opportunity arises, hybrid vehicles will be phased out in favour of a fully electric fleet.

To support the electric vehicle (EV) transition, EV charging stations are being installed across the Club’s facilities. Notably, 10 of parking spaces at Sha Tin Racecourse’s new multi-level car park are equipped with EV chargers.

 Water Management and Conservation



The Club’s Water Policy promotes efficient and responsible water use, effective discharge management, prevention of water pollution and compliance with legal and environmental standards.

Conghua Racecourse was designed to ensure separation of stormwater and wastewater. Greywater undergoes controlled routing to an on-site sewage treatment plant, facilitating its reuse for various applications. This approach conserves approximately 500-600m³ per day of freshwater, with approximately 39 of water used being recycled this year.

The Club is committed to responsible paper consumption and has implemented digital initiatives to reduce paper usage. Most recently this includes the Members’ Mobile App, which offers digital access to members’ communications and enables members to update their details electronically. Since 2015, the Club has been digitalising its procurement process, with an electronic sourcing and e-tendering platform being fully implemented this year.

 Nurturing Biodiversity

The Club seeks to nurture biodiversity through practices that aid the conservation and restoration of natural habitats. A prime example is the Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course (KSC), which has garnered international acclaim for its environmental stewardship, notably becoming the first golf course in the country to receive certification as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary for Wildlife and the first in the Asia-Pacific region to be certified by the Golf Environment Organisation.

 At Beas River Country Club

The Club has made a great effort to preserve biodiversity within the Members’ Garden, which is home to over 670 trees and a diversity of species. Encouragingly, the number of butterfly species recorded has increased from 17 to 73 over the past five years. In 2023, the garden was renovated to further enhance its biodiversity.

 Strategic Procurement

The Club is committed to sustainable business practices throughout its operations and those of its business partners and suppliers. The Club’s Supplier Sustainability Guidelines and Green Procurement Guidelines establish clear expectations for suppliers, encouraging greener products with improved recyclability, reduced packaging, longer lifespans and lower emissions of harmful substances. To evaluate the extent to which vendors embed sustainability into their procurement practices, the Club references the ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement Standard and other best practices. Additionally, the Club’s Supplier Management Framework evaluates whether suppliers are exposed to practices that adversely affect the environment and people within the supply chain.

 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

 2.1 Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRS”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the financial assets, financial liabilities and commodities at fair value through profit or loss which are carried at fair value.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are material to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.

 (c)

 (c) Impairment of financial assets

(i)

(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss



No impairment is recognised for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

(ii)

(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost

9

Impairment is assessed based on the expected credit loss (“ECL”) under HKFRS 9 on the reporting date.



For trade receivables, the Group considers that there is no significant financing component. Impairment is assessed based on the lifetime ECL.

12

Other financial assets including deposits, short-term deposits and cash and cash equivalents are placed with reputable financial institutions. The Group considers these counterparties have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows, and are of low credit risk. The impairment provision is determined based on the 12-month ECL.



The Group assesses whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition to determine its stage for impairment. The Group considers the credit risk of a financial asset has been significantly increased since initial recognition if any contractual cash flows from the financial asset have been past due for 30 days or more.



When a financial asset is unlikely to be recovered it is considered credit-impaired.



An exposure will migrate through the ECL stages as credit risk changes. If, in a subsequent period, an asset’s quality improves and also reverses any previously assessed significant increase in credit risk since origination, then the provision for doubtful debts reverts from lifetime ECL to 12-month ECL.



When there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, the default portion will be written off.



Such assets are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.



Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off reduce the amount of the expense in the income statement.



The Group measures ECL using the historical loss of the respective financial assets and considers reasonable and supportive forward-looking information that is available, including the following indicators:

- (a)
- (a) the counterparty’s external credit rating and its expected change;
- (b)
- (b) actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligations;
- (c)
- (c) significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the debtors, including changes in the payment pattern of debtors.

 2.9



Lease payments are allocated between the principal and interest expense. The interest expense is charged to profit or loss over the lease period based on the remaining balance of lease liability for each period.



Extension and termination options are included in a number of leases across the Group. Extension options or periods after termination options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not terminated.

 2.10



Properties that are held for long-term rental yields or capital appreciation or both, and that are not occupied by the entities in the Group, are classified as investment properties.

（）

Investment properties are measured initially at their cost, including related transaction costs, and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with their cost allocated to their residual values over their estimated useful lives at the same rate as buildings.



The gain or loss on disposal of investment property is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

 2.11



Intangible assets comprise computer software. Computer software is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and development of the item.



Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three to ten years. No amortisation is provided on projects in progress until they are ready for use in the manner as intended by management. On completion, the project costs are transferred to computer software.

 2.12



Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using weighted average cost less provision for diminution in value.

 2 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)

 2.18

 2.18 Employee benefits

(a)

(a) Defined benefit scheme



The defined benefit scheme (“Scheme”) provides pension benefits to employees upon retirement with reference to their final salaries.



The liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of the Scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.



The defined benefit obligation (“DBO”) is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.



The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market yields of government securities which have terms to maturity approximating terms of the related pension obligation.



Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

(b)

(b) Defined contribution scheme



Employer’s contributions to the defined contribution scheme are recognised as staff costs in the consolidated income statement for the year when they are due and are reduced by contributions forfeited by those employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully for the contributions.



The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

(c)

(c) Bonus and annual leave



The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses.



A provision for bonus is recognised where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.



Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees.



A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.

 2.19

 2.19 Donation



A donation is charged to the income statement and recognised as a liability when the donation has been offered to and accepted by the donee and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the legal and/or constructive obligation established.



Donations that are expected to be paid in future years are recorded at the present value of expected future payments, using the effective interest method.

 2.20

 2.20 Related party



For the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, a party is considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party in making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Group and the party are subject to common control.



Related parties may be individuals or entities.

 31.3 Fair value estimation (cont.)

2

The fair values of Level 2 assets and liabilities have been determined based on quotes from market makers or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs. The most significant input is market interest rates.

3

The assets classified as Level 3 and presented in the table consist mainly of alternative investments that are not traded in an active market. These have been valued based on information derived from individual fund reports, or audited reports received from respective fund managers, and considering other relevant factors if deemed necessary.

(a) 63011

(a) The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value as at 30 June. See note 11 for disclosures of fair value measurement of the investment properties.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

20246 30 20236 30

There were no transfers among the three fair value hierarchy levels classifications for the Group for the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023.

The following amendments to HKFRS have been published and are mandatory for the Trust’s accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2024.

| Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 | Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor or its Associate or Joint Venture |



The Trust is still assessing what the impact of the amendments to HKFRS will be in the period of initial application. It is not yet in a position to state whether these amendments to HKFRS will have a material impact on the Trust’s results of operations and financial position.

 2.2

 2.2 Joint arrangements

1111

The Trust has applied HKFRS 11 to its joint arrangement. Under HKFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.



The Trust has assessed the nature of its joint arrangement and determined it to be a joint venture as unanimous consent is required from all parties to the agreement for relevant activities. The joint venture is accounted for using the equity method.

 2.3

 2.3 Investments and derivatives

（HKJC Investment Trust Fund（Investment Trust））

Investments and derivatives (including investments in the HKJC Investment Trust Fund (“Investment Trust”)), are held for non-trading purposes, irrespective of whether they are classified as current or non-current. They are stated at fair value at the end of the reporting period.

2.4

The accounting policy for the financial assets of the investments and derivatives are stated in note 2.4.

 2.4

 2.4 Financial assets

(a)

(a) Classification

(i)(ii)

At initial recognition, the Trust classifies its financial assets as (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or (ii) financial assets at amortised cost. These financial assets include investments and derivatives.

(i)

(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

12

For debt instruments, the objective of the Trust’s business model is not to hold the assets to collect the contractual cash flows, and not to both hold the financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current assets. All equity instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss.



Alternative investments mainly include investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, private real estate funds and private credit funds.

12

The Trust uses derivative financial instruments to manage its financial risks and to facilitate the implementation of its investment strategies. These derivatives are classified as current as they are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period.

 2.5 Foreign currency translation (cont.)

 (b)

 (b) Transactions and balances



Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from translation at the year-end exchange rate of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised directly in the income statement. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period. The differences arising from translation are recognised in the income statement.

 2.6

 2.6 Revenue recognition



Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.



Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

 2.7

 2.7 Donations



Donation income is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive the payment is established.

 2.8

 2.8 Allocations to charitable organisations and community projects

╱

Allocations to charitable organisations and community projects are charged to the income statement and recognised as liabilities when the grant has been offered to and accepted by the grantee and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the legal and/or constructive obligation established.



Allocations awaiting payment that are expected to be paid in future years are recorded at the present value of expected future payments, using the effective interest method.

 2.9

 2.9 Forfeited dividends and refunds



In accordance with The Hong Kong Jockey Club’s Rules, certain dividends and refunds which are not claimed within the specified period are deemed to be donated for charitable purposes. These amounts are paid directly to the Trust.

 2.10

 2.10 Related party



For the purposes of these financial statements, a party is considered to be related to the Trust if the Trust has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party in making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Trust and the party are subject to common control. Related parties may be individuals or entities.

 2.11

 2.11 Commodities



Commodities are measured at fair value through profit or loss under non-current assets in the statement of financial position. The fair value or gain or loss is presented as surplus from commodities in the income statement.

 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS



In preparing the financial statements, management is required to exercise significant judgement in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions. The following significant accounting policies are impacted by judgements and uncertainties, for which different amounts may be reported under a different set of conditions or using different assumptions.

 3.1

 3.1 Recognition of allocations to charitable organisations and community projects



The Trust requires significant judgement to determine when allocations to charitable organisations and community projects are recognised as liabilities. In making this judgement, the Trust performs due diligence on the grant application review process, including assessing the grantees’ ability and willingness to honour the grant conditions, and evaluating the likelihood of an outflow of resources to settle the obligations.

 3.2

 3.2 Estimation of fair value of certain financial assets

12.3(d)

The fair value of certain financial assets at fair value through profit or loss that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation technique as detailed in note 12.3(d). The Trust determines the fair values of these financial assets primarily based on the net asset value of the funds and its interest held with reference to fund reports obtained from fund managers and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. The estimation of fair values is based on management’s best estimates.

╱（）╱（）

Where it is determined that the actual fair value is different from the estimated fair value that were recorded, such differences will impact the surplus/(deficit) from investments and derivatives and share of profits/(losses) of the joint venture in the period in which such a determination is made.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 6 INVESTMENT RETURNS

The Trust’s investments, including those included in the Investment Trust, were measured at fair value, including differences not yet realised as at year-end. Changes in fair value during the financial year were reflected in profit and loss. As such, they were susceptible to volatility in capital markets.

Markets performed well during the current financial year as global economic growth proved to be resilient despite the significant increase in interest rates in most major markets in 2022/23 and the outbreak of a second military conflict. For the Mainland, weakness in the real estate sector continued to weigh on the economy, although there have been recent signs of an improvement in economic conditions. The Trust maintained a diversified portfolio and recorded a gain of HK$4,396 million in the current financial year (2023: HK$3,674 million).

Investment returns include interest income from deposits, surplus/deficit from investments and derivatives, commodities, and share of profits/losses of the Investment Trust.

 7 SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

 7.1 Short-term deposits</h7>
The weighted average of the effective interest rate on short-term deposits was 5.50 (2023: 5.39). The carrying amounts of short-term deposits approximated their fair values and the weighted average of the maturities was 212 days (2023: 184 days).

 7.2 Cash and cash equivalents</h7>
