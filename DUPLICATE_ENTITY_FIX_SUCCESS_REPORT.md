## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Duplicate Detection Algorithm**
```python
# Find entities with same name but different UUIDs
MATCH (n:Company)
WITH n.name as name, collect(n) as nodes
WHERE size(nodes) > 1
RETURN name, nodes
ORDER BY size(nodes) DESC
```

### **Relationship Transfer Process**
```python
# 1. Transfer incoming relationships
MATCH (primary:Company {uuid: $primary_uuid})
MATCH (duplicate:Company {uuid: $dup_uuid})
MATCH (other)-[r]->(duplicate)
CREATE (other)-[new_r:RELATES_TO]->(primary)
SET new_r = properties(r)
DELETE r

# 2. Transfer outgoing relationships  
MATCH (duplicate)-[r]->(other)
CREATE (primary)-[new_r2:RELATES_TO]->(other)
SET new_r2 = properties(r)
DELETE r

# 3. Delete duplicate node
DELETE duplicate
```

### **Relationship Preservation**
- ✅ **All relationships preserved** during merge process
- ✅ **No data loss** - properties transferred completely
- ✅ **Referential integrity maintained** - all connections preserved

## 🎯 **Entity Normalization Testing Ready**

### **Now Available for Testing**
With duplicates fixed, the system can now properly test:

#### **1. Single Entity References**
- ✅ **"The Hong Kong Jockey Club"** - unified entity
- ✅ **"Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges"** - unified entity
- ✅ **All relationships consolidated** into single entities

#### **2. Multiple Reference Handling**
Test cases now possible:
```
Query: "Who is the CEO of HKJC?"
Expected: Should find "Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges" via LEADERSHIP relationship

Query: "What is Winfried's role at Hong Kong Jockey Club?"
Expected: Should find CEO/Chief Executive Officer role

Query: "Tell me about The Hong Kong Jockey Club leadership"
Expected: Should find Winfried and other executives
```

#### **3. Abbreviation Mapping**
```
Query: "What is HKJC?"
Expected: Should map to "The Hong Kong Jockey Club"

Query: "Who works at HKJC?"
Expected: Should find employees of "The Hong Kong Jockey Club"
```

- **Entity search**: Find unified entities by name
- **Relationship queries**: Discover connections between entities
- **Abbreviation handling**: Map HKJC to Hong Kong Jockey Club

### **3. Relationship Discovery**
Test complex queries:
- **"Who is connected to HKJC?"**
