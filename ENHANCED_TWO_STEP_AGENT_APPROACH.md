# üöÄ ENHANCED TWO-STEP AGENT APPROACH

## üéØ **Implementation Overview**

Successfully implemented the enhanced two-step approach for processing queries:

1. **Step 1**: Generate natural language answer based on the query
2. **Step 2**: Query Neo4j database again to get specific entities and relationships for graph visualization

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Process Flow**

```python
def process_message_with_agent(message: str, is_graph_query: bool = False) -> dict:
    """
    Enhanced two-step approach:
    1. Generate natural language answer based on the query
    2. Query Neo4j again to get specific entities and relationships for graph visualization
    """
    if is_graph_query:
        # Step 1: Generate natural language answer
        natural_answer = generate_natural_language_answer(message)
        
        # Step 2: Query Neo4j for graph visualization
        graph_data = query_neo4j_for_graph_visualization(message, natural_answer)
        
        return {
            'type': 'content',
            'content': natural_answer + graph_info,
            'graph_data': graph_data,
            'natural_answer': natural_answer,
            'step_1_complete': True,
            'step_2_complete': True
        }
```

## üìù **Step 1: Natural Language Answer Generation**

### **Key Features**

1. **Relationship Detection**: Automatically detects relationship queries
2. **Entity Extraction**: Extracts entities from queries using multiple patterns
3. **Natural Language Mapping**: Converts relationship types to human-readable descriptions
4. **Contextual Responses**: Provides meaningful answers based on found relationships

### **Example Transformations**

#### **Input Query**: `"What is the relation between 'Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges' and HKJC?"`

#### **Step 1 Output**: `"Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges is the CEO of The Hong Kong Jockey Club."`

### **Relationship Type Mapping**

```python
relationship_descriptions = {
    'CEO_OF': f"{source} is the CEO of {target}",
    'CHAIRMAN_OF': f"{source} is the Chairman of {target}",
    'DIRECTOR_OF': f"{source} is a Director of {target}",
    'SECRETARY_OF': f"{source} is the Secretary of {target}",
    'EMPLOYED_BY': f"{source} is employed by {target}",
    'WORKS_AT': f"{source} works at {target}",
    'MEMBER_OF': f"{source} is a member of {target}",
    # ... more mappings
}
```

### **Entity Extraction Patterns**

```python
patterns = [
    r"relation(?:ship)?\s+between\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?\s+and\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?",
    r"connection\s+between\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?\s+and\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?",
    r"how\s+is\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?\s+(?:related\s+to|connected\s+to)\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?",
    r"['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?\s+(?:works?\s+(?:at|for)|employed\s+by)\s+['\"]?([^'\"]+?)['\"]?",
    # ... more patterns
]
```

## üîç **Step 2: Focused Graph Visualization**

### **Key Features**

1. **Entity-Focused Queries**: Builds graph around specific entities from Step 1
2. **Relationship Discovery**: Finds direct and indirect connections
3. **Path Finding**: Discovers connection paths between multiple entities
4. **Optimized Results**: Limits results to keep graph focused and readable

### **Query Strategy**

#### **Entity-Centered Query**
```cypher
MATCH (n)-[r]-(connected)
WHERE n.name CONTAINS $entity_name
   OR toLower(n.name) CONTAINS toLower($entity_name)
RETURN n, r, connected
LIMIT 10
```

#### **Connection Discovery Query**
```cypher
MATCH path = (a)-[*1..2]-(b)
WHERE (a.name CONTAINS $entity1 OR toLower(a.name) CONTAINS toLower($entity1))
  AND (b.name CONTAINS $entity2 OR toLower(b.name) CONTAINS toLower($entity2))
RETURN path
LIMIT 5
```

### **Graph Data Structure**

```python
{
    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": "node_id",
            "labels": ["Person", "Entity"],
            "properties": {"name": "Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges", "position": "CEO"}
        }
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {
            "id": "rel_id",
            "type": "CEO_OF",
            "startNodeId": "person_id",
            "endNodeId": "company_id",
            "properties": {}
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "source": "focused_entity_query",
        "target_entities": ["Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges", "HKJC"],
        "total_nodes": 5,
        "total_relationships": 3
    }
}
```

---

## üéØ **Example Complete Flow**

### **Input Query**
```
"What is the relation between 'Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges' and HKJC?"
```

### **Step 1: Natural Language Answer**
```
"Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges is the CEO of The Hong Kong Jockey Club."
```

### **Step 2: Graph Visualization Query**
1. **Extract Entities**: `["Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges", "HKJC", "The Hong Kong Jockey Club"]`
2. **Query Neo4j**: Find nodes and relationships for these entities
3. **Build Graph**: Create focused visualization with 5-10 nodes and their connections

### **Final Response**
```json
{
    "type": "content",
    "content": "Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges is the CEO of The Hong Kong Jockey Club.\n\nüìä Graph visualization shows 5 entities and 3 relationships.",
    "graph_data": { /* focused graph data */ },
    "natural_answer": "Winfried Engelbrecht Bresges is the CEO of The Hong Kong Jockey Club.",
    "step_1_complete": true,
    "step_2_complete": true
}
```
